================================================================================

Each question includes:
- QUESTION: Clear, unambiguous wording
- BUSINESS INTENT: Why stakeholders care
- AUDIENCE: Who will use this insight (C-suite, operations, product, etc.)
- BUSINESS OBJECTIVE: What decision/action it enables
- DATA SOURCES: Exact tables and columns needed
- PRIORITY: Tier/Phase (1-8) and sequence

================================================================================

QUESTION 1: WHAT IS OUR BASELINE CHURN RATE?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What percentage of our customer base has churned in the analysis period, and how
does it compare to industry benchmarks?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Establish a single source of truth for churn rate—the most critical metric for
executive reporting, board communication, and retention goal-setting.

AUDIENCE:
C-Suite (CEO, CFO), Customer Success Leadership, Investor Relations

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Set baseline KPI for churn reduction targets
- Enable monthly churn tracking and goal progress reporting
- Justify investment in retention initiatives
- Communicate customer health status to stakeholders

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Churn_Flag (0/1 or Yes/No indicator)
    - Customer_ID (for distinct count)
    - Report_Month (for period filtering)
  Optional: Total_Revenue (for revenue-weighted churn rate variant)

PRIORITY: Tier 1 - Phase 1 (Foundational)
SEQUENCE: Question #1 (must build first—foundation for all others)

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Churn rate typically ranges 5–15% monthly depending on industry. Elevated rates
(>20%) suggest operational issues; low rates (<5%) may indicate data quality or
segment exclusion.

================================================================================

QUESTION 2: HOW HAS CHURN TRENDED OVER THE ANALYSIS PERIOD?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the month-over-month and trend direction of churn rate, and are there
seasonal patterns or inflection points that warrant investigation?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Detect seasonal patterns, growth/decline trends, and the impact of recent
retention campaigns or business changes on churn momentum.

AUDIENCE:
Customer Success Leadership, Product Management, Operations

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Identify seasonal peaks to target retention efforts (e.g., Q4 spike)
- Measure effectiveness of past retention campaigns
- Forecast near-term churn risk and proactively resource support
- Support long-term product roadmap decisions

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Churn_Date (for month derivation)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Signup_Date (optional, to create cohorts)
  Related: Create Calendar dimension with YearMonth column
  Measure: Monthly Churn Rate (%)

PRIORITY: Tier 1 - Phase 1 (Foundational)
SEQUENCE: Question #2 (depends on Q1 measures; use same base dimension)

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Common pattern: Q4 spike due to budget cycles; new customer cohorts show higher
initial churn; mature cohorts stabilize. Trend direction matters: rising churn
triggers escalation; falling churn validates retention strategies.

================================================================================

QUESTION 3: WHICH GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS SHOW THE HIGHEST CHURN RATES?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
How does churn rate vary by region (North, South, East, West), and which
regions require targeted retention efforts?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Allocate customer success and marketing budget to high-churn regions; enable
regional leadership accountability for retention metrics.

AUDIENCE:
Regional Sales Leaders, Customer Success Leadership, Marketing

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Regionalize retention strategy (e.g., localized support in East region)
- Identify regional service gaps or product fit issues
- Benchmark regions against peers and set regional targets
- Support hiring/resourcing decisions for customer success teams

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Region (from fact or dimension)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  Optional:
    - City, State (for deeper drill-down)
    - Total_Revenue (for revenue impact by region)

PRIORITY: Tier 3 - Phase 2 (Geographic segmentation)
SEQUENCE: Question #3 (foundational but builds on Q1-Q2 structure)

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Geographic variation often correlates with service availability, language support,
or local competition. E.g., urban East region may have lower churn due to better
infrastructure; rural West may need targeted outreach.

================================================================================

QUESTION 4: HOW DOES CHURN VARY BY CUSTOMER AGE GROUP?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the churn rate for each age group (18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 45+), and are
younger or older customers at higher risk?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Tailor engagement and retention messaging by generational cohort (e.g., digital
natives vs. traditional users may respond to different communication channels).

AUDIENCE:
Product Management, Marketing, Customer Success

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Personalize retention campaigns by age demographic
- Inform product feature prioritization (e.g., mobile-first for younger users)
- Identify lifecycle stage needs (e.g., onboarding intensity for new users)
- Guide HR hiring for customer-facing teams (e.g., digital natives for younger segment)

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn (via fact) or dim_customer (if separate)
  Columns Required:
    - Age_Group (standard buckets: 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 45+)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID

PRIORITY: Tier 4 - Phase 2 (Demographic segmentation)
SEQUENCE: Question #4

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Younger customers (18–25) often show higher churn due to lower commitment; older
cohorts (45+) show higher loyalty if onboarded successfully. Mid-career (26–35)
is often most valuable segment.

================================================================================

QUESTION 5: HOW DOES CONTRACT TYPE AFFECT CHURN RATES?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the churn rate for each contract type (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual), and
does contract length influence customer stickiness?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Optimize contract strategy—determine if shorter contracts (lower barrier to exit)
drive unnecessary churn, or if longer contracts lock in customers artificially.

AUDIENCE:
Sales Leadership, Product Management, Finance

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Optimize contract terms to balance acquisition with retention
- Forecast revenue stability (annual contracts = more predictable revenue)
- Design discount/incentive strategy for longer-term commitments
- Identify optimal renewal outreach timing by contract type

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn (direct) or dim_contract (via FK)
  Columns Required:
    - Contract_Type (Monthly / Quarterly / Annual)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Monthly_Charges (to understand pricing by contract type)
  Optional: Signup_Date to analyze contract adoption over time

PRIORITY: Tier 5 - Phase 3 (Service-level segmentation)
SEQUENCE: Question #5

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Typically: Monthly contracts show 2–3x higher churn than annual. However,
high-churn monthly may indicate poor product fit rather than contract terms.
Quarterly contracts often show moderate churn as "trial middle ground."

================================================================================

QUESTION 6: DOES PAYMENT METHOD CORRELATE WITH CHURN?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the churn rate for each payment method (Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI,
Cash), and does payment friction contribute to churn?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Identify if billing/payment issues are a churn driver; simplify or incentivize
preferred payment methods to ease retention.

AUDIENCE:
Finance, Customer Success, Billing Operations

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Reduce failed payment churn by optimizing payment options
- Incentivize automated payments (credit card, UPI with auto-renew)
- Identify payment method adoption gaps (e.g., low UPI adoption = market opportunity)
- Support cash-based markets by offering alternatives

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn (direct) or dim_payment (via FK)
  Columns Required:
    - Payment_Method (Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI, Cash)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  Optional: Auto_Renewal flag (if available) to assess auto-payment impact

PRIORITY: Tier 5 - Phase 3 (Service-level segmentation)
SEQUENCE: Question #6

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Cash-based payments often show higher churn (manual renewal friction). Credit
cards with auto-renew show lowest churn. UPI adoption varies by region (higher
in urban India, lower rural).

================================================================================

QUESTION 7: HOW DOES CUSTOMER TENURE INFLUENCE CHURN RATE?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the churn rate for customers in different tenure buckets (0–3 months,
4–6 months, 7–12 months, 12–24 months, 24+ months), and when is churn risk highest?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Identify "critical risk windows" for churn intervention—most churn occurs early;
stabilizing early tenure improves LTV dramatically.

AUDIENCE:
Onboarding/Customer Success Leadership, Product Management

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Intensify onboarding for cohorts with >15% early churn
- Design graduated engagement cadence (aggressive early, taper over time)
- Forecast cohort-level LTV and payback period
- Inform acquisition strategy (if early churn is high, improve product fit before scaling)

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Tenure_Months (or derived from Signup_Date and Report_Month)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
    - Join_Date / Signup_Date (to calculate tenure buckets)

PRIORITY: Tier 6 - Phase 2 (Behavioral segmentation)
SEQUENCE: Question #7 (foundational for understanding churn lifecycle)

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
"Churn bathtub curve": High initial churn (0–3 months, 20–40%), drops sharply
(4–12 months, 5–10%), stabilizes (12+, <3%). Early intervention here has highest ROI.

================================================================================

QUESTION 8: HOW DOES USAGE LEVEL CORRELATE WITH CHURN RISK?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the difference in average monthly usage between churned and active
customers, and does declining usage predict churn?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Early detection: low/declining usage is a leading churn indicator; enable
proactive outreach before churn occurs.

AUDIENCE:
Customer Success, Product Management, Data Analytics

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Build usage-based alert system for at-risk customers
- Identify product gaps where usage is zero/low (feature adoption problem)
- Design engagement workflows triggered by usage drops
- Measure product adoption success (high usage = low churn)

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Monthly_Usage (or Usage_Score, depending on available column)
    - Avg_Usage_Last_3_Months (if available for trend detection)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  Derived: Usage_Change (current usage vs. previous month)

PRIORITY: Tier 6 - Phase 3 (Behavioral & engagement analysis)
SEQUENCE: Question #8

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Clear pattern: Churned customers show 30–50% lower usage in 3 months prior to
churn. Setting usage threshold (e.g., <50% of average) triggers outreach. This
is one of the highest-value early warning signals.

================================================================================

QUESTION 9: ARE SUPPORT TICKET VOLUMES A CHURN INDICATOR?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the average number of support tickets for churned vs. active customers?
Do high support ticket volumes correlate with higher churn risk?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Validate hypothesis: are support tickets evidence of frustration (churn driver)
or active engagement (churn preventer)? Design support strategy accordingly.

AUDIENCE:
Customer Success, Support Leadership, Operations

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Identify if high ticket volume = quality issue or usage intensity
- Optimize support SLAs and resolution time targets (longer resolution = higher churn)
- Allocate support resources to high-risk accounts
- Set support ticket KPIs aligned with churn reduction

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Support_Tickets (count of tickets)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  Optional: Resolution_Time_Days (quality metric)
  Related: Complaint_Flag (if available)

PRIORITY: Tier 6 - Phase 3 (Behavioral & engagement analysis)
SEQUENCE: Question #9

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Often bimodal: Zero tickets may indicate non-engagement (churn risk). Very high
tickets (>5/month) without resolution = frustration (churn driver). Sweet spot
is 1–3 tickets/month (active usage, issues resolved quickly). Pattern depends on
product complexity.

================================================================================

QUESTION 10: HOW DOES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION RELATE TO CHURN?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the average satisfaction score for churned vs. active customers, and is
there a satisfaction threshold below which churn becomes highly probable?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Use satisfaction as an early warning system; prioritize follow-up for low
satisfaction customers before churn occurs.

AUDIENCE:
Customer Success, Product Management, C-Suite (for quality metrics)

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Set satisfaction drop threshold that triggers outreach
- Identify product/service quality gaps (low satisfaction = specific issue)
- Correlate satisfaction with revenue/LTV impact
- Measure effectiveness of support improvements on churn reduction

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Satisfaction_Score (numeric, 1–5 scale typical)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  Optional: Feedback text (for root cause analysis—outside Power BI scope)

PRIORITY: Tier 7 - Phase 3 (Customer experience)
SEQUENCE: Question #10

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Typically: Satisfaction 4–5 = <2% churn. Satisfaction 2–3 = 15–25% churn.
Satisfaction <2 = >40% churn. There's usually a "cliff" at satisfaction 2–3
where churn risk multiplies. This metric is highly actionable for targeted outreach.

================================================================================

QUESTION 11: WHICH CUSTOMER SEGMENTS ARE AT HIGHEST CHURN RISK?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the churn rate for each combination of key segments (e.g., new customers
in East region with monthly contracts), and can we identify a high-risk profile?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Create targeted retention playbooks for each high-risk segment; allocate limited
retention budget to maximum-impact groups.

AUDIENCE:
Customer Success Leadership, Regional Sales Leaders, Finance

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Segment portfolio into risk tiers (low/medium/high)
- Design segment-specific retention playbooks (e.g., new corporate customers need
  dedicated onboarding; price-sensitive SME need discount retention)
- Forecast revenue at risk by segment
- Justify proactive investment in high-risk groups vs. reactive churn management

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Customer_Segment (Retail / SME / Corporate, if available)
    - Region
    - Tenure_Months (or derived bucket)
    - Contract_Type
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  Derived: Multi-dimensional risk score (see DAX section for calculation)

PRIORITY: Tier 4 - Phase 3 (Segmentation & risk)
SEQUENCE: Question #11

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Often: New SME customers in East region with monthly contracts show >30% churn.
Mature Corporate customers in North/West show <5%. These profiles enable precise
resource allocation (e.g., focus CS resources on new SME segment first).

================================================================================

QUESTION 12: WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CHURN? (Revenue-at-Risk Analysis)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What is the total revenue lost from churned customers in the analysis period?
Which customer segments or regions represent the highest revenue at risk?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Quantify churn cost in financial terms to justify retention investment (e.g.,
"Churn costs $500K/quarter; $2M investment in CS reduces churn by 2% = ROI").

AUDIENCE:
CFO, C-Suite, Finance, Sales Leadership

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Justify retention investment by showing revenue impact
- Prioritize retention efforts on high-revenue-impact segments
- Calculate customer LTV and payback period by segment
- Inform decision: acquire or retain (e.g., if LTV > 2x acquisition cost, invest
  in retention)

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Churn_Flag
    - Total_Revenue (or Monthly_Charges x Tenure_Months)
    - Customer_ID
    - Customer_Segment (to prioritize which revenue matters most)
    - Region
  Optional: Acquisition_Cost (if available, to calculate LTV and payback)

PRIORITY: Tier 7 - Phase 4 (Financial impact)
SEQUENCE: Question #12

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Common finding: 10% of customers generate 40% of revenue (Pareto principle).
Churn of high-revenue customers (Corporate/Premium) impacts than churn,
even if Retail churn rate is higher. This drives prioritization of premium segment
retention (e.g., dedicated account manager for $10K+ ARR customers).

================================================================================

QUESTION 13: ARE THERE EARLY WARNING SIGNALS THAT PREDICT IMMINENT CHURN?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
What combination of behavioral signals (low usage, high support tickets, low
satisfaction) are most correlated with churn in the 30–60 days before churn occurs?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Enable predictive outreach: proactively engage at-risk customers within the
critical "intervention window" before churn becomes irreversible.

AUDIENCE:
Customer Success, Operations, Analytics

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Build churn risk scoring model in Power BI (non-ML; purely rule-based)
- Create automated alerts for high-risk accounts (e.g., usage drop >50% = red flag)
- Design intervention playbooks by risk level (low risk = quarterly check; high risk
  = daily monitoring)
- Measure intervention effectiveness: % of at-risk customers retained after outreach

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Monthly_Usage / Usage_Score / Avg_Usage_Last_3_Months
    - Support_Tickets
    - Satisfaction_Score
    - Churn_Flag
    - Churn_Date (to backfill 30/60-day lookback)
    - Customer_ID
  Derived: Usage_Change, Churn_Probability_Score (rule-based weights)

PRIORITY: Tier 8 - Phase 4 (Risk scoring and early warning)
SEQUENCE: Question #13 (advanced; depends on Q7–Q10 measures)

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Typical early warning profile (60 days before churn):
  - Usage drop > 30% from baseline
  - Support tickets > 2x monthly average
  - Satisfaction drop by 1+ point from customer's baseline
  - Payment failed once (if available)
Customers meeting 3+ criteria have 60%+ churn probability within 30 days.
Triggering outreach at this point recovers 25–40% of at-risk customers.

================================================================================

QUESTION 14: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MONTHLY CHARGES AND CHURN RATE?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FULL QUESTION:
How does price sensitivity manifest in churn rates? Are higher-priced customers
more likely to churn, and does this vary by customer type or region?

BUSINESS INTENT:
Inform pricing and discounting strategy. Determine if churn is "price-driven"
(support discounting strategy) or "value-driven" (need product improvement).

AUDIENCE:
Finance, Pricing/Product Management, Sales Leadership

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
- Optimize pricing tiers (e.g., if $X/month price > 2x industry, expect churn)
- Design discounting strategy weighted by churn risk (discount high-risk, higher-LTV
  customers; don't discount low-risk)
- Segment pricing by geography (price tolerance differs by region)
- Evaluate impact of past price increases on churn cohorts

DATA SOURCES:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Monthly_Charges
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
    - Customer_Segment / Region (to understand price sensitivity by segment)
    - Contract_Type (annual customers more price-sensitive at renewal than monthly)

PRIORITY: Tier 5 - Phase 3 (Service-level analysis)
SEQUENCE: Question #14

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
Bimodal pattern often observed:
  - Low price (<$50/mo): High churn due to low commitment, not price
  - Mid price ($50–$200/mo): Moderate churn, price-sensitive at renewal
  - High price (>$200/mo): Lower churn if value clear; high churn if ROI unclear
Regional variation: Price sensitivity higher in developing markets; lower in
developed markets (where budget is less constrained).
