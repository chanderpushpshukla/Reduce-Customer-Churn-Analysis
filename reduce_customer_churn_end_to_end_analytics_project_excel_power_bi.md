# Project Research: Reduce Customer Churn

## 1. Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over a given period when they stop using a company’s products or services. Reducing customer churn is a critical business objective because acquiring new customers is typically more expensive than retaining existing ones. Even a small reduction in churn can significantly improve revenue, profitability, and long-term sustainability.

This project focuses on **understanding, measuring, and reducing customer churn** using **Excel and Power BI only**, without machine learning models or complex DAX. The emphasis is on **descriptive and diagnostic analytics**—answering *what is happening*, *where churn is happening*, and *why it is happening*, followed by **actionable business recommendations**.

## 2. Why This Project Is Important

### Business Problems Addressed
- Declining customer base and revenue leakage
- High cost of acquiring new customers
- Lack of visibility into customer behavior and dissatisfaction
- Reactive rather than proactive customer retention strategies

### Business Value
- Identifies high-risk customer segments
- Highlights key drivers of churn (pricing, service issues, usage decline, etc.)
- Enables data-driven retention strategies
- Supports management decision-making through dashboards

---

## 3. Project Objectives

1. Measure overall customer churn rate
2. Identify churn patterns across time, geography, and customer segments
3. Analyze behavioral and transactional factors linked to churn
4. Provide clear insights using Excel and Power BI visuals
5. Recommend practical, non-technical retention actions

---

## 4. Scope and Constraints

### In Scope
- Historical customer data analysis
- Descriptive and diagnostic analytics
- Dashboard creation in Power BI
- Business-focused insights and recommendations

### Out of Scope
- Machine learning or predictive modeling
- Advanced DAX calculations
- Real-time or streaming data

---

## 5. End-to-End Project Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Business Understanding

**Key Questions**
- What defines a churned customer?
- Over what time period is churn measured?
- Which customer attributes matter most to the business?

**Deliverables**
- Clear churn definition
- Agreed churn period (monthly/quarterly)
- Stakeholder-aligned KPIs

---

### Phase 2: Data Collection

**Typical Data Sources**
- Customer master data (ID, demographics, location)
- Transaction or usage data
- Subscription or account status data
- Customer support or complaint logs

**Key Considerations**
- Data completeness
- Consistent customer identifiers
- Time granularity (daily, monthly)

---

### Phase 3: Data Cleaning (Excel / Power Query)

**Common Cleaning Activities**
- Removing duplicate customer records
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing date formats
- Correcting inconsistent category labels
- Creating calculated columns (tenure, churn flag)

**Tools Used**
- Excel formulas
- Power Query Editor

---

### Phase 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Goals of EDA**
- Understand customer distribution
- Detect early churn signals
- Identify anomalies and patterns

**Typical Analyses**
- Churn rate by month
- Churn by customer tenure
- Churn by geography or segment
- Usage trends before churn

**Excel Techniques**
- Pivot tables
- Conditional formatting
- Summary statistics

---

### Phase 5: Analysis & Insights

**Key Analytical Dimensions**

1. **Time-Based Analysis**
   - Monthly churn trends
   - Seasonality patterns

2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - New vs long-term customers
   - High-value vs low-value customers

3. **Behavioral Indicators**
   - Drop in usage or transactions
   - Increase in complaints

4. **Service & Pricing Factors**
   - Impact of plan changes
   - Contract type vs churn

---

### Phase 6: Power BI Dashboard Development

**Dashboard Objectives**
- Single source of truth for churn metrics
- Easy interpretation for non-technical stakeholders

**Core Visuals**
- KPI cards (Total Customers, Churn Rate)
- Line charts for churn trends
- Bar charts for churn by segment
- Tables for detailed drill-down

**Design Principles**
- Minimal DAX
- Clear labels and filters
- Business-friendly layout

---

### Phase 7: Interpretation & Business Findings

**Typical Findings**
- Higher churn among new customers
- Specific regions or plans with elevated churn
- Strong correlation between low engagement and churn

**Focus**
- Translate numbers into business language
- Explain *why* churn is happening, not just *where*

---

### Phase 8: Recommendations & Action Plan

**Strategic Recommendations**
- Improve onboarding for new customers
- Targeted retention offers for high-risk segments
- Proactive customer support outreach
- Review pricing or service issues

**Operational Recommendations**
- Regular churn monitoring dashboard
- Monthly churn review meetings
- Data quality improvement initiatives

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- Reduction in churn rate
- Improvement in customer lifetime value
- Increased retention in high-value segments
- Adoption of dashboards by stakeholders

---

## 7. Final Outcome of the Project

This project delivers a **clear, structured, and business-oriented churn analysis framework** using only Excel and Power BI. It empowers stakeholders to understand churn drivers, monitor trends, and take informed actions—without relying on complex models or advanced analytics.

The project can be reused, scaled, and adapted across industries such as telecom, banking, retail, and subscription-based services.
