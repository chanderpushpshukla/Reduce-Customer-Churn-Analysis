POWER BI CHURN ANALYSIS: COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
CHUNK 5 - CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE & FINANCIAL IMPACT (QUESTIONS 10–12)
================================================================================

DOCUMENT VERSION: 1.0
DATE: February 2026
SCOPE: Questions 10–12 (Satisfaction, Risk Segmentation, Revenue Impact)
COMPLEXITY: Advanced—introduces financial metrics, executive reporting, scenario modeling

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CHUNK 5
================================================================================

This chunk implements customer experience and financial impact analysis that
directly supports executive decision-making and board reporting:

- Question 10: How does customer satisfaction relate to churn? (CSAT linkage)
- Question 11: Which customer segments are at highest churn risk? (Risk matrix)
- Question 12: What is the financial impact of churn? (Revenue-at-risk & LTV)

These questions enable:
- CFO/Finance-focused business cases (ROI of retention investment)
- Executive dashboards with KPIs and financial metrics
- Risk segmentation and portfolio management
- Scenario modeling ("If we reduce churn by X%, revenue impact is…")

Key Insight: Questions 10–12 connect operational metrics (churn %) to business impact ($).

DELIVERABLES:
1. Satisfaction measurement framework and visuals
2. Multi-dimensional risk segmentation matrix
3. Financial impact calculations (revenue at risk, LTV, payback period)
4. Executive dashboard with financial KPIs
5. Scenario modeler setup (parameterized what-if analysis)
6. Board-ready summary and business case template

ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium-High (6–8 hours; includes financial calculations,
currency formatting, and executive-level visuals)

SECTION 1: DATA REQUIREMENTS & PREPROCESSING (Q10–Q12)
================================================================================

1.1 DATA SOURCES & COLUMNS

For Q10 (Satisfaction):
  Source: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Satisfaction_Score (numeric, 1–5 scale): CSAT rating
    - NPS_Score (numeric, -100 to +100, optional): Net Promoter Score
    - Complaint_Flag (Yes/No): Whether customer filed complaint
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
    - Report_Month
  
  Data Quality:
    - Satisfaction_Score: 1–5 only, no nulls (fill blanks with median 3)
    - NPS_Score: -100 to +100 (if present); convert to NPS category (Detractor, Passive, Promoter)
    - No outliers (e.g., satisfaction = 10)

For Q11 (Risk Segmentation):
  Source: fact_customer_churn + all dimensions (Age, Contract, Payment, Region, Tenure, Usage)
  Columns Required:
    - ALL dimensions from Q4–Q9 (Age_Group, Contract_Type, Region, Tenure_Bucket, etc.)
    - Churn_Risk_Profile (calculated in Chunk 4, Section 3.1)
    - Customer_Segment (if available: Retail, SME, Corporate)
    - Monthly_Charges
    - Total_Revenue
  
  Data Quality:
    - All dimensions populated (no unknowns)
    - Monthly_Charges > 0 (no free tier; or separate free tier analysis)
    - Churn_Risk_Profile calculated and validated

For Q12 (Financial Impact):
  Source: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
    - Total_Revenue (cumulative revenue from customer to date)
    - Monthly_Charges (recurring monthly fee)
    - Join_Date (to calculate lifetime)
    - Churn_Date (to calculate revenue at loss date)
    - Acquisition_Cost (optional; for LTV calculation)
  
  Data Quality:
    - Total_Revenue: Non-negative, realistic (validate outliers)
    - Monthly_Charges: Consistent; matches contract type pricing
    - No negative revenue (refunds handled separately)
    - Currency: Consistent (USD, EUR, etc.; not mixed)

1.2 POWER QUERY PREPROCESSING

For Q10, standardize Satisfaction_Score:

  STEP 1: Fill Blanks with Median
  - Select Satisfaction_Score
  - Transform > Replace Values
  - Find: (blank/error)
  - Replace: 3 (median of 1–5 scale)
  - Click Replace All

  STEP 2: Create NPS Category (if NPS_Score available)
  - Add Column > Conditional Column
  - Name: "NPS_Category"
  - Formula:
    if [NPS_Score] >= 9 then "Promoter"
    else if [NPS_Score] >= 7 then "Passive"
    else "Detractor"

  STEP 3: Create Satisfaction Tier
  - Add Column > Conditional Column
  - Name: "Satisfaction_Tier"
  - Formula:
    if [Satisfaction_Score] >= 4 then "Satisfied"
    else if [Satisfaction_Score] = 3 then "Neutral"
    else "Dissatisfied"

For Q11, ensure all dimensions present (from Chunks 3–4):

  Verify columns exist:
    - Age_Group (from Q4)
    - Contract_Type (from Q5)
    - Payment_Method (from Q6)
    - Tenure_Bucket (from Q7)
    - Usage_Category (from Q8)
    - Region (from Q3)
    - Customer_Segment (if available)
    - Churn_Risk_Profile (calculated in Chunk 4)

For Q12, validate financial columns:

  STEP 1: Ensure Monthly_Charges > 0
  - Filter > Remove rows where Monthly_Charges <= 0
  - (If free tier needed, create separate analysis)

  STEP 2: Calculate Lifetime Value
  - Add Column > Custom Column
  - Name: "Customer_LTV"
  - Formula: [Total_Revenue] (if already cumulative)
    OR: [Monthly_Charges] * [Tenure_Months] (if need to calculate)

  STEP 3: Calculate Months Until Churn (for projections)
  - Add Column > Custom Column
  - Name: "Months_to_Churn"
  - Formula:
    if [Churn_Flag] = TRUE then
      DATEDIFF([Churn_Date], [Join_Date], "M")
    else
      DATEDIFF(TODAY(), [Join_Date], "M") // Still active

================================================================================
SECTION 2: DAX MEASURES FOR QUESTIONS 10–12
================================================================================

2.1 SATISFACTION MEASURES (Q10)

MEASURE 1: Average Satisfaction Score (All Customers)
Purpose: Monitor overall customer satisfaction; leading indicator for retention
Audience: CEO, VP Customer Success, Board (as retention risk metric)

DAX CODE:
  Avg Satisfaction (All) = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score])
  
  Avg Satisfaction Churned = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )
  
  Avg Satisfaction Active = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )

Comment: Satisfaction 4.0+ = healthy; 3.0–3.9 = at-risk; <3.0 = critical.
Format: Decimal, 1 place (e.g., 3.7/5.0)

MEASURE 2: Satisfaction Distribution (Count by Tier)
Purpose: Segment customers by satisfaction level for targeted intervention
Audience: Customer Success, Retention teams

DAX CODE:
  Satisfied Customers (4-5) = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score] >= 4
  )
  
  Neutral Customers (3) = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score] = 3
  )
  
  Dissatisfied Customers (1-2) = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score] <= 2
  )

Comment: Used for waterfall chart and segmentation
Format: Whole number (e.g., 850, 600, 250)

MEASURE 3: Satisfaction-Churn Linkage (Cross-tabulation measure)
Purpose: Quantify churn risk by satisfaction level
Audience: Analytics, Product (evidence of satisfaction → retention link)

DAX CODE:
  Churn Rate by Satisfaction = 
    VAR SatisfactionGroup = VALUES('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score])
    RETURN
      IF(
        HASONEVALUE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score]),
        [Churn Rate %],
        BLANK()
      )

  // Alternative explicit version:
  Churn Rate at Satisfaction Tier = 
    VAR TierCount = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
    VAR TierChurned = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    RETURN
      IF(TierCount = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(TierChurned, TierCount) * 100)

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
  Satisfaction 5: 3% churn
  Satisfaction 4: 5% churn
  Satisfaction 3: 18% churn (cliff)
  Satisfaction 2: 35% churn
  Satisfaction 1: 60% churn

2.2 RISK SEGMENTATION MEASURES (Q11)

MEASURE 4: High-Risk Customer Segments (Count)
Purpose: Identify total customers in high-risk segments for portfolio prioritization
Audience: Executive, Sales, Customer Success

DAX CODE:
  High Risk Segment Count = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),

    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE() // Active customers only (at-risk)
  )

Comment: Shows # of customers needing urgent retention attention.
Format: Whole number (e.g., 127 customers)

MEASURE 5: Segment Churn Rate Matrix (3–4 dimensions)
Purpose: Cross-tabular churn rates by multiple dimensions
Audience: Segment owners, Regional leaders

DAX CODE:
  Churn Rate % (Multi-dim) = [Churn Rate %]
  
  // Comment: Standard [Churn Rate %] measure automatically filters by
  // multiple dimension context (Age × Contract × Region, etc.)

Use Case:
  Create matrix visual:
    ROWS: Age_Group
    COLUMNS: Contract_Type
    VALUES: [Churn Rate %]
    
  OUTPUT:
    Age Group | Monthly | Quarterly | Annual
    ─────────────────────────────────────
    18–25     | 28.3%   | 16.2%     | 8.5%
    26–35     | 18.5%    | 12.8%     | 4.2%
    36–45     | 14.1%    | 9.3%      | 2.8%
    45+       | 11.8%    | 8.2%      | 2.1%

  Interpretation: Youngest + Monthly = highest churn (28.3%); Oldest + Annual = lowest (2.1%)

MEASURE 6: Revenue-Weighted Risk Score
Purpose: Identify highest-impact risk segments (account for customer value)
Audience: Finance, Sales, CFO

DAX CODE:
  Revenue at Risk = 
    CALCULATE(
      SUM('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Charges]) * 
        COUNTROWS(
          FILTER(
            'fact_customer_churn',
            'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Risk_Profile] = "Critical"
          )
        ),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE() // Only at-risk, still active
    )

  // Simpler alternative:
  Revenue from Critical Risk = CALCULATE(
    SUM('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Charges]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Risk_Profile] = "Critical",
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )

Comment: Weights risk by revenue impact. Example: 50 critical customers @ $100/mo each 
         = $5,000/month revenue at risk.
Format: Currency ($), 0 decimals (e.g., $15,000)

Purpose: Quantify financial impact of churn for business case
Audience: CFO, Board, Finance

DAX CODE:
  Total Revenue Lost (Churned) = CALCULATE(
    SUM('fact_customer_churn'[Total_Revenue]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )

Comment: Cumulative revenue lost from all churned customers to date.
Example: 679 churned customers × avg $150 revenue = $101,850 loss
Format: Currency ($), 0 decimals

MEASURE 8: Monthly Revenue Churn (Recurring Revenue Lost)
Purpose: Forecast recurring revenue impact (MRR loss)
Audience: Finance, CFO (revenue forecast)

DAX CODE:
  MRR Lost to Churn = CALCULATE(
    SUM('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Charges]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )

Comment: Annualized MRR loss = MRR Lost × 12
Example: If 60 customers churn/month @ avg $50/mo each = $3,000 MRR loss = $36,000 ARR
Format: Currency ($), 0 decimals

MEASURE 9: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) by Segment
Purpose: Value each customer segment to inform retention investment priorities
Audience: CFO, Finance (payback analysis)

DAX CODE:
  Avg LTV = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_LTV])
  
  // If Customer_LTV not pre-calculated:
  Avg LTV (Calculated) = 
    AVERAGE(
      'fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Charges] * 'fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months]
    )
  
  // By segment (e.g., by Contract Type):
  LTV by Contract = 
    CALCULATE(
      AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_LTV]),
      ALL('fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag]) // Average of all, not filtered by churn
    )

Comment: Example LTVs:
  - Monthly contract: Avg $500 LTV (short tenure)
  - Annual contract: Avg $1,800 LTV (long tenure)
  - Insight: Annual contracts worth 3.6x monthly; justifies 20% discount

Format: Currency ($)

MEASURE 10: Revenue at Risk (Projected Annual Loss)
Purpose: Forecast annual revenue impact if churn continues at current rate
Audience: CFO, Executive team

DAX CODE:
  Annual Revenue at Risk = [MRR Lost to Churn] * 12

  // Alternative: Project current churn rate forward
  Projected Annual Churn Loss (Cohort) = 
    VAR CurrentChurnRate = [Churn Rate %] / 100
    VAR ActiveCustomers = [Active Customers]
    VAR AvgMonthlyCost = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Charges])
    VAR ProjectedMonthlyChurn = ActiveCustomers * CurrentChurnRate
    RETURN
      ProjectedMonthlyChurn * AvgMonthlyCost * 12

Comment: If current churn 15% / 1,000 active customers @ $75/mo average:
  Projected annual loss = 150 churn/month × $75 × 12 = $135,000 ARR at risk

Format: Currency ($)

MEASURE 11: Payback Period (for retention investment)
Purpose: Justify retention spend (if CS investment = $X, payback = Y months)
Audience: CFO, Finance

DAX CODE:
  Payback Period Months = 
    VAR RetentionInvestment = 50000 // Example: $50K/year CS team cost
    VAR MonthlyRetentionSavings = [MRR Lost to Churn]
    RETURN
      IF(MonthlyRetentionSavings = 0, BLANK(), RetentionInvestment / MonthlyRetentionSavings)

Comment: If $50K investment prevents $10K MRR churn = 5 months payback (ROI > 2x annually)
Example calculation:
  - Current MRR churn: $3,000/month ($36K/year lost)
  - CS team cost: $120K/year
  - Assumed prevention: 30% churn reduction (save $10.8K/year)
  - ROI = $10.8K / $120K = 9% direct ROI (not including:
    improved NPS, reduced acquisition to replace, brand damage prevention)

Format: Decimal, 1 place (e.g., 5.4 months)

================================================================================
SECTION 6: EXPECTED INSIGHTS & BUSINESS OUTCOMES (Q10–Q12)
================================================================================

6.1 QUESTION 10: SATISFACTION & CHURN LINKAGE

Expected Insight:
  - Churn rate by satisfaction score:
    • Satisfaction 5/5: 2% churn (highly loyal)
    • Satisfaction 4/5: 5% churn (satisfied)
    • Satisfaction 3/5: 18% churn (neutral, at-risk) ← CLIFF
    • Satisfaction 2/5: 35% churn (dissatisfied)
    • Satisfaction 1/5: 60% churn (very dissatisfied, almost certain to leave)
  
  - Current organization: Avg sat 3.7 = ~12% implied churn (reasonably healthy)
  - Satisfaction slight leading indicator (drops 2–4 weeks before churn)

Business Action:
  1. Satisfaction monitoring:
     - Monthly CSAT survey (post-interaction, NPS/CSAT)
     - Alert: If org-wide avg drops below 3.5, escalate (churn risk rising)
     - Segment alerts: If segment avg drops 1+ point, investigate

  2. Targeted improvement:
     - For satisfaction 1–2 customers: Immediate outreach
       "We see your experience has been below expectations. Here's how we can help:…"
       Goal: Bring from 1–2 → 3–4 satisfaction (reduce churn 60% → 5%)

     - For satisfaction 3 (neutral): Engagement campaigns
       "Here are your top features. Did you know about [advanced feature]?"
       Goal: Increase to satisfaction 4 (reduce churn 18% → 5%)

  3. CS team training:
     - Tie CS metrics to satisfaction (not just ticket count)
     - Resolution quality > speed (happier customers at satisfaction 4)
     - Measure: Repeat issues (indicate poor resolution)

Expected Business Outcome:
  - Improve org-wide satisfaction from 3.7 → 4.0 within 6 months (via improvements above)
  - Churn reduction: Each 0.3-point improvement = ~1% churn reduction
  - Target: 4.0 satisfaction → 10–12% churn (3–5 percentage point reduction)

6.2 QUESTION 11: RISK SEGMENTATION & PRIORITIZATION

Expected Insight:
  - Portfolio breakdown:
    • 18–25, Monthly, Cash: 28.3% churn, $15K/month charges @ risk (highest priority)
    • 26–35, Monthly, Debit: 18.5% churn, $8K/month charges @ risk (2nd priority)
    • 36–45, Quarterly, CC: 9.3% churn, $3K/month charges @ risk (3rd priority)
    • 45+, Annual, CC: 2.1% churn, $2K/month charges @ risk (low priority)
  
  - **Revenue-weighted** risk: 10% of segments drive 40% of churn losses (Pareto)
  - Focus on top 3–4 segments = 80% of impact

Business Action:
  1. Segment-specific playbooks:
     - 18–25 (highest risk): Intensive onboarding, gamification, daily touchpoints first week
     - 26–35 (medium risk): Standard onboarding + QBR at month 6, cross-sell at month 9
     - 36–45 (lower risk): Light touch + value updates quarterly
     - 45+ (low risk): Renewal focus only, premium support offer

  2. Resource allocation:
     - If 10 CS managers, allocate:
       • 5 to highest-risk segment (ROI per manager highest here)
       • 3 to medium-risk
       • 2 to lower-risk

  3. Pricing/contract strategy:
     - 18–25 Monthly: Offer "3-month trials at annual pricing" (reduce churn 28% → 15%)
     - 26–35 Monthly: Offer quarterly commitment + 10% discount (reduce churn 18% → 12%)
     - Older cohorts: Reduce discount (already low-risk)

Expected Business Outcome:
  - Reduce high-risk segment churn from 28.3% to 18% within 1 year (via targeted retention)
  - Revenue impact: 280 customers @ $45/mo = $12.6K/month saved
  - Total portfolio churn: 17% → 15% (2% overall reduction, ~$50K/year ARR impact)

6.3 QUESTION 12: FINANCIAL IMPACT & BUSINESS CASE

Expected Insight (Example Numbers):
  
  Current State:
    - 4,000 active customers
    - 679 churned in period (17% churn rate)
    - Avg revenue per customer: $75/month
    - Total MRR lost to churn: 679 @ $75 = $50,925/month = $611,100 ARR

  Projected Annual Impact:
    - If churn continues at 17%, lose $611K annual revenue
    - Equivalent to: 611K / 1000 customers = $611 avg revenue per customer per year lost

  LTV Impact:
    - Avg customer tenure: 18 months
    - Avg LTV: $75/mo × 18 mo = $1,350 per customer
    - Lost value from churn: 679 churned × $1,350 = $917,000

Investment Case:
    - CS team cost: $150K/year (3 FTE @ $50K each)
    - If CS reduces churn from 17% → 14% (3% reduction):
      Saved customers = 4,000 × 0.03 = 120 retained
      Revenue saved = 120 × $900 (yearly value) = $108,000
      ROI = ($108K revenue saved - $150K cost) / $150K = -28% (negative)
    
    - If CS reduces churn from 17% → 12% (5% reduction):
      Saved customers = 4,000 × 0.05 = 200 retained
      Revenue saved = 200 × $900 = $180,000
      ROI = ($180K - $150K) / $150K = +20% (positive, justifies investment)

Business Action:
  1. Investment justification:
     - "Current churn costs $611K/year"
     - "$150K CS investment can prevent 30% of churn (save $180K+)"
     - "ROI breakeven: 5% churn reduction" (achievable via onboarding + support improvements)

  2. Monitor unit economics:
     - CAC payback period: 3–6 months (depending on $churn savings)
     - If initial acquisition cost $200/customer, payback = 3–4 months (healthy)
     - Focus on reducing churn in first 6 months (highest payback impact)

  3. Scenario modeling:
     - Model A: Invest $150K in CS → reduce churn 5% → save $180K (ROI +20%)
     - Model B: Invest $50K in product improvements → reduce churn 2% → save $72K (ROI +44%)
     - Model C: Invest $80K in both → reduce churn 7% → save $252K (ROI +96%, optimal)

Expected Business Outcome:
  - Business case approved: Invest in CS + product improvements
  - Churn reduction target: 17% → 12% (5% overall reduction, $180K+/year)
  - LTV improvement: $1,350 → $1,575 (+16.7% per customer)
  - 2-year financial impact: Cumulative $450K+ revenue retention
