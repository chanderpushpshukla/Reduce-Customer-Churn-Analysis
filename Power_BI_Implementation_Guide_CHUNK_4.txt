POWER BI CHURN ANALYSIS: COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
CHUNK 4 - BEHAVIORAL & ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS (QUESTIONS 7–9)
================================================================================

DOCUMENT VERSION: 1.0
DATE: February 2026
SCOPE: Questions 7–9 (Tenure Lifecycle, Usage Correlation, Support Quality)
COMPLEXITY: Intermediate-Advanced—introduces behavioral segmentation & trend analysis

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CHUNK 4
================================================================================

This chunk implements behavioral and engagement metrics that are most predictive
of imminent churn:
- Question 7: How does customer tenure influence churn rate? (lifecycle stages)
- Question 8: How does usage level correlate with churn risk? (engagement signal)
- Question 9: Are support ticket volumes a churn indicator? (satisfaction proxy)

These questions enable:
- Lifecycle-based retention strategies (different playbooks per stage)
- Early warning systems (usage drops = churn alert)
- Support quality monitoring and CS team performance tracking

Key Insight: Questions 7–9 are highest-value for PROACTIVE intervention.
  Usage decline detects at-risk customers 30–60 days before churn.
  Support quality is often the CAUSE of churn (root cause, not symptom).
  Tenure reveals when intervention timing matters most (early days are critical).

DELIVERABLES:
1. Tenure bucketing and calculated columns (Power Query)
2. Eight DAX measures (tenure, usage, support metrics)
3. Four visuals (scatter, box plot, area chart, detailed table)
4. New report page: "Behavioral & At-Risk Indicators Dashboard"
5. Early warning signal setup (foundation for Chunk 6 alerts)
6. Playbook recommendations per lifecycle stage

ESTIMATED EFFORT: Medium-High (6–8 hours including advanced visuals and measures)

================================================================================
SECTION 1: DATA REQUIREMENTS & PREPROCESSING (Q7–Q9)
================================================================================

1.1 DATA SOURCES & COLUMNS

For Q7 (Tenure Lifecycle):
  Source: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Tenure_Months (numeric): Customer tenure in months at analysis date
      OR: Join_Date (date) + Report_Month (date) to calculate tenure
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
    - Report_Month
  
  Calculation (if Tenure_Months not present):
    Tenure_Months = MONTH(Report_Month) - MONTH(Join_Date) + (YEAR(Report_Month) - YEAR(Join_Date)) * 12
    OR in Power BI: DATEDIF([Join_Date], [Report_Month], "M")

  Data Quality:
    - Tenure_Months: Non-negative, typically 0–60 range
    - No nulls expected
    - Consistent: All customers in same Report_Month have consistent tenure

For Q8 (Usage Engagement):
  Source: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Monthly_Usage (numeric): Usage metric (e.g., transactions, API calls, feature uses)
    - Avg_Usage_Last_3_Months (numeric, optional): Rolling average for trend
    - Usage_Change (numeric, optional): Month-over-month change %, derived
    - Usage_Score (numeric, 1–100 scale, optional alternative to Monthly_Usage)
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  
  Calculation (if Usage_Change missing):
    Usage_Change = (Current_Month_Usage - Prior_Month_Usage) / Prior_Month_Usage
    This indicates engagement trend (positive = growing, negative = declining)
  
  Data Quality:
    - Monthly_Usage: Non-negative, realistic ranges (0–10,000 typical)
    - No extreme outliers (>99th percentile reviewed)
    - Missing/null values: Fill with 0 (inactive) or average (see Chunk 2)

For Q9 (Support Quality):
  Source: fact_customer_churn
  Columns Required:
    - Support_Tickets (numeric): Count of support tickets in period
    - Complaint_Flag (Yes/No): Whether complaint was raised
    - Satisfaction_Score (numeric, 1–5 scale): CSAT or NPS proxy
    - Resolution_Time_Days (numeric, optional): Average days to resolve ticket
    - Churn_Flag
    - Customer_ID
  
  Data Quality:
    - Support_Tickets: Count, 0–20 typical (high outliers = troubled accounts)
    - Satisfaction_Score: 1–5 only; no blanks (fill with median if missing)
    - Resolution_Time: Days, 0–30 typical

1.2 POWER QUERY PREPROCESSING

STEP 1: CREATE TENURE BUCKETS (if not present)

In Power Query Editor:

  1. Add Column > Conditional Column
  2. Name: "Tenure_Bucket"
  3. Formula:
     
     if [Tenure_Months] is null then "Unknown"
     else if [Tenure_Months] <= 3 then "0–3 months (New)"
     else if [Tenure_Months] <= 6 then "4–6 months (Onboarding)"
     else if [Tenure_Months] <= 12 then "7–12 months (Established)"
     else if [Tenure_Months] <= 24 then "13–24 months (Mature)"
     else "25+ months (Loyal)"

  4. Click OK

M CODE (Alternative):
  #"Added Tenure Bucket" = Table.AddColumn(
    #"Previous", "Tenure_Bucket",
    each if [Tenure_Months] = null then "Unknown"
         else if [Tenure_Months] <= 3 then "0–3 months (New)"
         else if [Tenure_Months] <= 6 then "4–6 months (Onboarding)"
         else if [Tenure_Months] <= 12 then "7–12 months (Established)"
         else if [Tenure_Months] <= 24 then "13–24 months (Mature)"
         else "25+ months (Loyal)"
    , type text)

STEP 2: CREATE USAGE CATEGORIES (if not present)

  1. Add Column > Conditional Column
  2. Name: "Usage_Category"
  3. Formula:
     
     if [Monthly_Usage] is null then "Not Available"
     else if [Monthly_Usage] = 0 then "Zero (Inactive)"
     else if [Monthly_Usage] < (Column Average of Monthly_Usage / 2) then "Low"
     else if [Monthly_Usage] < (Column Average of Monthly_Usage * 1.5) then "Medium"
     else "High"

  4. Click OK (or calculate average first for precision)

M CODE:
  #"Added Usage Category" = Table.AddColumn(
    #"Previous", "Usage_Category",
    each if [Monthly_Usage] = null then "Not Available"
         else if [Monthly_Usage] = 0 then "Zero (Inactive)"
         else if [Monthly_Usage] < 20 then "Low"
         else if [Monthly_Usage] < 50 then "Medium"
         else "High"
    , type text)

  // Note: Replace 20, 50 with your column's actual thresholds

STEP 3: DERIVE USAGE_CHANGE (Month-over-Month)

If Usage_Change not already in source, calculate it:

  1. Sort by: Customer_ID (ascending), then Report_Month (ascending)
  2. Add Column > Custom Column
  3. Name: "Prior_Month_Usage"
  4. Formula: 
     
     try Number.FromText([Monthly_Usage]) otherwise null
     // (Can reference prior row if using Advanced mode, but simpler approach is
       to merge with self on Customer_ID and Report_Month-1)

  For M (more complex but accurate):
  
  #"Sorted" = Table.Sort(Source, {{"Customer_ID", Order.Ascending}, {"Report_Month", Order.Ascending}}),
  #"Added Prior Month Usage" = Table.AddColumn(#"Sorted", "Prior_Month_Usage",
    each 
      let
        CurrentCustomer = [Customer_ID],
        CurrentMonth = [Report_Month],
        PriorMonth = Date.AddMonths(CurrentMonth, -1),
        LookupUsage = Table.SelectRows(#"Sorted", each [Customer_ID] = CurrentCustomer and [Report_Month] = PriorMonth),
        UsageValue = if Table.RowCount(LookupUsage) > 0 then LookupUsage[Monthly_Usage]{0} else null
      in
        UsageValue
  , type number),
  #"Added Usage Change %" = Table.AddColumn(#"Added Prior Month Usage", "Usage_Change_Pct",
    each if [Prior_Month_Usage] = null or [Prior_Month_Usage] = 0 then null
         else ([Monthly_Usage] - [Prior_Month_Usage]) / [Prior_Month_Usage] * 100
  , type number)

  // Note: This M code is complex; simpler approach: Create Pivot in Power BI DAX instead

STEP 4: STANDARDIZE SATISFACTION_SCORE

  - Replace blanks with median (e.g., 3)
    Replace Values: Find blank → Replace: 3
  - Ensure type is Decimal Number
  - Range check: 1 ≤ Satisfaction_Score ≤ 5

STEP 5: CLEAN SUPPORT_TICKETS COLUMN

  - Ensure type is Whole Number
  - Replace errors with 0 (no ticket = no error)
  - Replace blanks with 0

================================================================================
SECTION 2: DAX MEASURES FOR QUESTIONS 7–9
================================================================================

2.1 TENURE-BASED MEASURES (Q7)

MEASURE 1: Average Tenure by Churn Status
Purpose: Compare average tenure of churned vs. active customers
Audience: Product, Customer Success (identify when churn typically happens)

DAX CODE:
  Avg Tenure Months (All) = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months])
  
  Avg Tenure Churned = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )
  
  Avg Tenure Active = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )

Comment: These measures reveal if churn is "early-stage" (low avg tenure) or evenly distributed.
Example: If Avg Tenure (Churned) = 4 months, churn is early-stage (focus onboarding).

MEASURE 2: Churn Rate by Tenure Bucket
Purpose: Churn % within each lifecycle stage
Audience: Product, CS Leadership (lifecycle-specific strategies)

DAX CODE:
  Churn Rate % (by Tenure) = [Churn Rate %]
  
  // Comment: [Churn Rate %] measure from Chunk 2 auto-filters by Tenure_Bucket
  // when Tenure_Bucket is in visual context.

For explicit measure (if preferred):

  Churn by Tenure = 
    VAR TenureTotal = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
    VAR TenureChurned = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    RETURN
      IF(TenureTotal = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(TenureChurned, TenureTotal) * 100)

MEASURE 3: Early-Stage Customer Health Score (Derived)
Purpose: Identify risk profile for new customers (0-6 months)
Audience: Onboarding Team (track cohort health)

DAX CODE:
  New Customer Health = 
    VAR NewCustomers = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] <= 6
    )
    VAR NewCustomersChurned = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] <= 6,
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    VAR EarlyChurnRate = DIVIDE(NewCustomersChurned, NewCustomers)
    RETURN
      IF(EarlyChurnRate > 0.25, "Red", IF(EarlyChurnRate > 0.15, "Yellow", "Green"))

Comment: Categorizes early-stage health (red = >25% churn, yellow = 15–25%, green = <15%)
Use Case: Alerts (red = escalate to VP CS)

2.2 USAGE-BASED MEASURES (Q8)

MEASURE 4: Average Usage (by Churn Status)
Purpose: Compare engagement levels between churned and active customers
Audience: Product, Customer Success (usage disconnect from churn)

DAX CODE:
  Avg Usage (All Customers) = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage])
  
  Avg Usage Churned = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )
  
  Avg Usage Active = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )

Comment: If Avg Usage (Churned) << Avg Usage (Active), usage is strong churn predictor.
Example: Churned avg 5 units, Active avg 45 units → usage drop signals churn.

MEASURE 5: Usage Decline Alert (Derived)
Purpose: Identify customers with significant usage drop (early warning)
Audience: Customer Success (trigger intervention)

DAX CODE:
  Usage Declining = 
    VAR AverageUsage = [Avg Usage (All Customers)]
    VAR CurrentUsage = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Avg_Usage_Last_3_Months])
    VAR DeclineThreshold = AverageUsage * 0.5 // More than 50% below average
    RETURN
      IF(ISBLANK(CurrentUsage), "No Data",
        IF(CurrentUsage < DeclineThreshold AND [Churn_Flag] = FALSE(), "Alert", "Normal"))

Comment: Flags customers with usage <50% of baseline (high churn risk, still active)
Use Case: Trigger CS outreach: "Your usage is declining—how can we help?"

MEASURE 6: Inactive Customer Count
Purpose: Count customers with zero usage in period
Audience: Onboarding, CS (high-risk segment)

DAX CODE:
  Inactive Customers = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage] = 0
  )

Comment: Inactive customers (usage = 0) have 3–5x higher churn probability.
Use Case: Reactivation campaign target list.

2.3 SUPPORT-QUALITY MEASURES (Q9)

MEASURE 7: Average Support Tickets (by Churn Status)
Purpose: Determine if support ticket volume is churn driver (frustration) or indicator
Audience: Support Leadership, CS (support quality link to churn)

DAX CODE:
  Avg Support Tickets (All) = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Support_Tickets])
  
  Avg Support Tickets Churned = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Support_Tickets]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )
  
  Avg Support Tickets Active = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Support_Tickets]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )

Comment: Interpretation depends on pattern:
  - If Churned avg >> Active avg: High tickets = churn driver (support failure)
  - If Churned avg = Active avg: Tickets not driver (unrelated to churn)

MEASURE 8: Support Satisfaction Link
Purpose: Measure correlation between support tickets and satisfaction
Audience: Support Leadership (improvement targeting)

DAX CODE:
  Avg Satisfaction Score (All) = AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score])
  
  Avg Satisfaction Churned = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )
  
  Avg Satisfaction Active = CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )

Comment: If Satisfaction (Churned) = 2.1 / 5 vs. Active = 4.0 / 5 → satisfaction is strong churn driver.

MEASURE 9: High-Risk Support Customers
Purpose: Identify customers with high ticket volume AND low satisfaction (at-risk)
Audience: Support, CS (urgent intervention candidates)

DAX CODE:
  High Risk Support Customers = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Support_Tickets] >= 3, // 3+ tickets
    'fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score] <= 2, // Low satisfaction (1–2 / 5)
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE() // Still active (not yet churned)
  )

Comment: These are "at-risk" customers (60%+ churn risk within 30 days).
Use Case: Daily monitoring; trigger personal outreach from VP/Account Manager.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: CALCULATED COLUMNS FOR Q7–Q9
================================================================================

3.1 CALCULATED COLUMNS IN DAX

Column 1: Tenure_Years (if Tenure_Months exists)
Purpose: Human-readable tenure (years instead of months)
Location: Model > Add Column to fact_customer_churn

DAX CODE:
  Tenure_Years = DIVIDE('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months], 12, 0)

Use: Visual display (e.g., "2.5 years" is more intuitive than "30 months")

Column 2: Lifecycle_Stage (explicit version if Power Query bucket insufficient)
Purpose: Business-friendly lifecycle label
Location: Model > Add Column to fact_customer_churn

DAX CODE:
  Lifecycle_Stage = 
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] <= 3, "New Customer",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] <= 6, "Onboarding",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] <= 12, "Established",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] <= 24, "Mature",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] > 24, "Loyal", "Unknown")))))

Use: Reports, filters, drill-down tables

Column 3: Usage_Status (derived from usage level)
Purpose: Categorize engagement level
Location: Model > Add Column

DAX CODE:
  Usage_Status = 
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage] = 0, "Inactive",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage] < 20, "Below Average",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage] < 50, "Average",
    IF('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage] <= 100, "Above Average", "Power User"))))

Use: Engagement dashboard, targeted playbooks

Column 4: Churn_Risk_Profile (composite; uses multiple columns)
Purpose: Multi-factor risk scoring (no ML; rule-based)
Location: Model > Add Column

DAX CODE:
  Churn_Risk_Profile = 
    VAR RiskScore = 
      (IF('fact_customer_churn'[Tenure_Months] < 6, 1, 0) +  // New = +1 risk
       IF('fact_customer_churn'[Monthly_Usage] < 20, 1, 0) +  // Low usage = +1 risk
       IF('fact_customer_churn'[Support_Tickets] >= 3, 1, 0) + // High tickets = +1 risk
       IF('fact_customer_churn'[Satisfaction_Score] <= 2, 1, 0)) // Low satisfaction = +1 risk
    RETURN
      IF(RiskScore >= 3, "Critical",
      IF(RiskScore = 2, "High",
      IF(RiskScore = 1, "Medium", "Low")))

Comment: Scores 0–4 points based on risk factors; maps to risk tier (Critical–Low)
Use: Alert system, intervention prioritization, dashboard highlighting

    (Adjust benchmark to your industry standard)

EXPECTED DISPLAY (Bathtub Curve):
  ```
  Churn Rate Across Customer Lifetime
  40% ┤ ╱‾‾╲
      │╱    ╲

      0–3  4–6  7–12  13–24  25+
      (months)
  ```
  
  Interpretation:
  - High early churn (0–3 months: ~35–40%): Inadequate onboarding
  - Sharp drop (4–6: ~15–20%): Natural stabilization
  - Stable middle (7–24: ~10–15%): Established customers, steady
  - Low late (25+: ~5–10%): Loyal base, high LTV

POSITIONING ON REPORT PAGE:
  - Top-left corner of new "Behavioral & Engagement" page
  - Occupy 3 columns × 2 rows (~800px × 400px)

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
  If bathtub curve visible: Early-stage churn (onboarding issue) confirmed.
  Action: Invest in onboarding improvements (training, support, check-ins).
  
  If flat curve (e.g., 18% across all tenures): Churn is not tenure-driven;
  investigate other factors (Q8, Q9, Q4–Q6).

4.2 VISUAL 2: SCATTER PLOT FOR USAGE VS. CHURN (Q8)

PURPOSE: Visualize relationship between usage and churn; identify at-risk (low usage, active) customers

Visual Type: Scatter Chart (XY scatter)

FIELD CONFIGURATION:
  - X-AXIS: [Monthly_Usage] (engagement level)

  5 ┤ ∘∘∘∘∘∘∘∘∘∘ (green = active, satisfied, high usage)
    │
  3 ┤     ∘●●●●●  (●red●●●●● = churned, low engagement)
    │
  1 ┤  ●●●●●●●●   (red right-side = churned, low usage)

    ┴─────────────────
      0    25  50  75
      Monthly Usage
  
  Legend: ∘ Active | ● Churned
  ```

INTERPRETATION:
  - Left side (low usage): Red bubbles = at-risk, already churned
  - Left-Green: At-risk BEFORE churn (proactive target)
  - Right side (high usage): Green bubbles = active, engaged
  - Pattern: Clear cluster of red low-usage = usage is strong churn signal

POSITIONING ON REPORT PAGE:
  - Top-right, next to area chart
  - Occupy 3 columns × 2 rows (~800px × 400px)

DRILL-THROUGH / INTERACTIVITY:
  - Enable drill-through to "Customer Details" page (Q12)
  - Clicking red bubble → shows details of churned customer, usage history
  - Use case: "Why did this customer churn? Usage was zero for 2 months."

4.3 VISUAL 3: BOX & WHISKER PLOT FOR SUPPORT QUALITY (Q9)

PURPOSE: Show distribution of support metrics; identify support quality issues correlating w/ churn

Visual Type: Box Plot (or Combo chart if Box not available)

  Y-Axis:
    - Min: 0, Max: 20 (or 99th percentile)
    - Gridlines: ON

EXPECTED DISPLAY:
  ```
  Support Ticket Distribution by Churn Status
  20┤  ●  (outlier)
    │  │

   5┤  ├───┤
    │  │   │
    │  │   │
   0┴──┴───┴───

     Churned  Active

  Boxes: Churned has higher median (~3) vs. Active (~1)
  This shows: Churned customers tend to open more support tickets
  Interpretation: Could be (A) precursor to churn or (B) sign of poor support
  ```

INTERPRETATION:
  - If Churned median >> Active median: High support = churn precursor
    Action: Improve support quality (faster resolution) and CS follow-up
  - If similar medians: Support volume not driver; investigate other factors
  - Outliers (extreme support tickets): Flag for manual review

POSITIONING ON REPORT PAGE:
  - Middle-left, below area chart
  - Occupy 2 columns × 2 rows (~600px × 350px)

ALTERNATIVE (IF BOX PLOT NOT AVAILABLE):
  Use Clustered Column Chart:
    - X-axis: Churn_Flag (Churned / Active)

================================================================================
SECTION 6: TESTING & VALIDATION (Q7–Q9)
================================================================================

6.1 DATA VALIDATION CHECKLIST

☐ Tenure_Months: values 0–60+, no nulls, matches Join_Date to Report_Month
  Verify: Data view > Column Profile > Tenure_Months shows min/max/avg

☐ Monthly_Usage: values 0–10,000+ (realistic), no negatives
  Verify: Column Profile > No red flags

☐ Support_Tickets: whole numbers, 0–20 typical, no negatives
  Verify: Column Profile > Distinct values ≤ 100

☐ Satisfaction_Score: 1–5 only, no blanks (filled if was missing)
  Verify: Column Profile > Min=1, Max=5, no nulls

☐ Calculated columns (Tenure_Bucket, Usage_Category, Churn_Risk_Profile):
  All populated, no blanks, expected values present
  Verify: Data view > Scroll through sample rows

6.2 MEASURE VALIDATION (Spot-Check Calculations)

Test [Avg Tenure Churned]:
  1. Create pivot in Excel: Customer_ID, Churn_Flag, Tenure_Months
  2. Filter: Churn_Flag = 1 (only churned)
  3. Calculate: AVERAGE(Tenure_Months)
  4. Compare to Power BI card showing [Avg Tenure Churned]
  
  EXPECTED: Excel ≈ PBI (±0.5 months acceptable)

Test [Avg Usage Churned] and [Avg Usage Active]:
  1. Pivot: Churn_Flag, Monthly_Usage (avg)
  2. Calculate for both true and false
  3. Compare to measures
  
  EXPECTED: Churned <<< Active (usage gap confirms churn-engagement link)

Test [High Risk Support Customers]:
  1. Count rows: Support_Tickets >= 3 AND Satisfaction_Score <= 2 AND Churn_Flag = 0
  2. Verify against [High Risk Support Customers] measure
  
  EXPECTED: Count matches within ±0 (exact match, no rounding)

6.3 VISUAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

☐ AREA CHART (Tenure)
  ☐ Shows bathtub curve (high left, dips middle, low right)
  ☐ X-axis order correct (0–3, 4–6, 7–12, 13–24, 25+)
  ☐ Y-axis 0% to max churn %
  ☐ Area filled below line
  ☐ Data labels readable on each point
  ☐ Filters update curve: Changing Report_Month re-draws chart

☐ SCATTER PLOT (Usage)
  ☐ X-axis: Usage 0–max range
  ☐ Y-axis: Satisfaction 1–5 or Tickets 0–max
  ☐ Red bubbles (churned): Concentrated low-left (low usage, low satisfaction)
  ☐ Green bubbles (active): Spread across, many on right (high usage)
  ☐ Bubble size proportional to Monthly_Charges
  ☐ Hover tooltip shows Customer_ID, Tenure, etc.

☐ BOX PLOT (Support Quality)
  ☐ Two boxes: "Churned" (left), "Active" (right)
  ☐ Churned box median higher than Active (more tickets)
  ☐ Whiskers extend to min/max
  ☐ Outliers shown as red dots above
  ☐ Y-axis 0 to max tickets

☐ AT-RISK CUSTOMER TABLE
  ☐ Rows: Only Critical + High risk customers, Churn_Flag = FALSE
  ☐ Sorted: Critical first, then high; within each, newest tenure first
  ☐ Columns formatted correctly (numbers, percentages, decimals)
  ☐ Row colors: Red (critical), Orange (high)
  ☐ Horizontally scrollable if many columns
  ☐ Rows clickable: Drill-through on click

6.4 INTERACTION TESTING

Test 1: Lifecycle Filter
  Step: Set Lifecycle_Stage slicer to "New Customer" (0–3 months)
  Expected:
    - Area chart shows only "0–3 months" bar (or filters data to that tenure)
    - Scatter plot shows only new customers (left side)
    - Table shows only new customers
    - Churn rate for new := ~30%+ (early high churn)
  Pass/Fail: ___

Test 2: Risk Profile Filter
  Step: Set Churn_Risk_Profile to "Critical" only
  Expected:
    - Table shows only critical customers (red)
    - All other visuals still show full data (filters not cascaded to charts;
      only to table, to avoid over-filtering)
  Pass/Fail: ___

Test 3: Month Change
  Step: Set Report_Month to different month (e.g., 3 months prior)
  Expected:
    - All visuals update
    - Key metrics change (different at-risk count, different avg usage)
    - Area chart data refreshed (churn rates per tenure for that month)
  Pass/Fail: ___

6.5 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR Q7–Q9

CRITERION 1: TENURE LIFECYCLE ANALYSIS (Q7)
✓ Area chart shows clear bathtub curve (high early, low late)
✓ Churn rate at 0–3 months ≥ 25% (high early churn evident)
✓ Churn rate at 25+ months < 10% (mature stability evident)
✓ Values match manual Excel pivot ±0.5%
PASS WHEN: Bathtub curve visible and quantified; early-stage churn confirmed

CRITERION 2: USAGE CORRELATION ANALYSIS (Q8)
✓ Scatter plot shows red bubbles clustered low-left (churned = low usage)
✓ Avg usage (churned) < Avg usage (active) by at least 50%
✓ Usage threshold identified (e.g., <20 units = churn risk)
✓ Green bubbles in low-usage area (at-risk but active) are targets for intervention
PASS WHEN: Usage as churn predictor is visually clear and quantified

CRITERION 3: SUPPORT QUALITY ANALYSIS (Q9)
✓ Box plot or comparison shows support ticket distribution
✓ If churned median > active median: Support quality is churn driver candidate
✓ High vs. low satisfaction customers show clear churn difference
✓ [High Risk Support Customers] count populated and accurate
PASS WHEN: Support quality link to churn quantified; at-risk customers identified

================================================================================
SECTION 7: EXPECTED INSIGHTS & BUSINESS OUTCOMES (Q7–Q9)
================================================================================

7.1 QUESTION 7: TENURE LIFECYCLE BATHTUB CURVE

Expected Insight:
  - 0–3 months: 35–40% churn (highest risk window)
  - 4–6 months: 15–20% churn (critical stabilization period)
  - 7–12 months: 8–12% churn (established, stable)
  - 13–24 months: 5–8% churn (mature, loyal emerging)
  - 25+ months: 3–5% churn (loyal, long-term)

Business Action:
  1. Onboarding intervention (0–3 months):
     - Dedicated onboarding CS resource (1:1 check-ins weekly)
     - Product orientation: Feature walkthrough, key use cases
     - Quick wins: Within 1st week, show value
     - Check-in cadence: Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90

  2. Stabilization (4–6 months):
     - Reduce touch frequency (weekly → bi-weekly)
     - Success metrics: Key adoption milestones (e.g., "invited 3 team members")
     - Risk trigger: If usage declining, escalate back to weekly

  3. Mature (7–24 months):
     - Shift to value expansion (cross-sell, advanced features)
     - QBR (quarterly business review) cadence
     - Risk trigger: Low usage, no feature adoption, satisfaction drop

  4. Renewal focus (24+ months):
     - Renewal calls at 60 days prior to renewal date
     - Document ROI achieved
     - Upsell opportunities (increased seats, premium features)

Expected Business Outcome:
  - Reduce 0–3 month churn from 35% to 25% within 6 months (via better onboarding)
  - Increase cohort-level LTV by 15–20% (mature customers worth more)
  - Lower CAC payback period (if early churn drops, payback faster)

7.2 QUESTION 8: USAGE AS EARLY WARNING SIGNAL

Expected Insight:
  - Churned customers: Avg usage 12 units/month
  - Active customers: Avg usage 45 units/month
  - Usage ratio = 0.27 (churned use only 27% of active baseline)
  
  USAGE THRESHOLD: <20 units/month = churn risk zone (2x base risk)
  - Zero usage = 5x base churn risk (essentially at-risk regardless of other factors)
  
  LEADING INDICATOR: Usage decline >50% in 30 days = imminent churn (60–90% probability in next 30 days)

Business Action:
  1. Usage-based alerts:
     - Automated dashboard: Flag customers with usage <20 or zero for 14+ days
     - Alert: CS team receives daily/weekly list (via email or dashboard)
     - SLA: CS contacts customer within 24 hours of flag

  2. Reactivation playbook (for zero-usage customers):
     - Sequence 1: Email "We noticed you haven't logged in—here's a quick start guide"
     - Sequence 2 (3 days later): "Here's a customer story from similar business—1-min read"
     - Sequence 3 (7 days later): CS phone call "Let's find time for 15-min training"
     - Sequence 4 (14 days later): Manager offer "If we can sort this, ready to help?"

  3. Usage norm by segment:
     - Different products have different baselines
     - Set usage thresholds by: Product type, Industry, Customer segment
     - Example: SaaS CRM baseline 30 units/mo; if <15, flag

  4. Measure reactivation success:
     - Of customers with zero usage flagged, % who reach 20+ units within 30 days = success metric
     - Track: Reactivation rate, time-to-reactivation, LTV impact

Expected Business Outcome:
  - Recover 20–30% of at-risk (low-usage) customers via proactive outreach
  - Reduce overall churn by 2–3 percentage points (if 15–20% of at-risk base recoverable)
  - Revenue retention: Each recovered customer = X months of retained MRR

7.3 QUESTION 9: SUPPORT QUALITY & CHURN LINKAGE

Expected Insight:
  - Churned customers: Avg 3.2 support tickets, Avg satisfaction 2.1 / 5
  - Active customers: Avg 1.0 support tickets, Avg satisfaction 3.8 / 5
  
  INTERPRETATION: High support tickets + low satisfaction = churn signal (or cause)
  - Could be causation: Poor support → frustration → churn
  - Could be proxy: Customers with issues → contact support → churn if unresolved
  
  SATISFACTION CLIFF: Satisfaction <3 = 3x churn risk vs. satisfaction 4–5
  Critical threshold: If avg satisfaction drops below 3.0 for cohort, escalate

Business Action:
  1. Support quality improvements:
     - Resolution time: Track SLA (e.g., <48 hrs first response, <7 days resolution)
     - Satisfaction feedback: Post-ticket survey (NPS or CSAT question)
     - Root cause: Analyze churned customer tickets—what issues unresolved?
     - Example finding: "20% of churned customers had unresolved billing issues"
     - Answer: Assign billing specialist to support team, cross-train

  2. Escalation triggers:
     - Customer opens 3+ tickets without satisfaction survey response: Escalate to manager
     - Customer satisfaction drops from 4 to <2 in 30 days: Trigger outreach
     - Customer has 3+ tickets AND satisfaction <2: High-risk tag → daily monitoring

  3. Support playbook by risk tier:
     - High-Risk (3+ tickets, sat <2): Manager phone call + action plan
     - Medium-Risk (2 tickets, sat = 3): Dedicated CS touch + resource commitment
     - Low-Risk (1 ticket, sat >3): Standard support + proactive offers

Expected Business Outcome:
  - Reduce avg support tickets for at-risk cohort from 3.2 to 2.0 (faster resolution)
  - Increase satisfaction score for at-risk from 2.1 to 3.0+ (acceptable level)
  - Churn reduction: 1-point satisfaction increase = ~5–10% churn reduction (typical impact)

7.4 COMBINED INSIGHTS (Q7–Q9)

META-PATTERN:
  New customers (0–3 mo) + Zero usage + 2+ support tickets + Satisfaction <2 = CRITICAL RISK
  
  TYPICAL STORY:
  1. Customer signs up (day 0)
  2. Doesn't use product in first week (adoption gap)
  3. Opens support ticket (confused) on day 7
  4. Gets generic response (not helpful)
  5. Opens 2nd ticket day 14 (frustrated)
  6. No satisfactory resolution (still confused)
  7. Satisfaction drops to 1–2 / 5
  8. Churns day 45 (end of free trial or month 1)
  
  ROOT CAUSE: Onboarding failure + support inadequacy

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
  1. Segment: Identify new customers (0–3 mo) with zero usage (0–7 days)
  2. Rank: Sort by highest support ticket count (3+ = urgent)
  3. Intervene: Daily manager outreach, offer training, reset satisfaction
  4. Measure: Track reactivation rate; target 25–30% recovery

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
  Reduce 0–3 month churn from 35% to 20% within 90 days (via coordinated
  onboarding + support + usage monitoring intervention).

================================================================================
SECTION 8: TRANSITION TO CHUNK 5
