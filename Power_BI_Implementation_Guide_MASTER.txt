PART 2: DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS (Q1–Q14)
================================================================================

================================================================================
SECTION I: QUESTIONS 1–3 (CORE INFRASTRUCTURE & DATA MODELING)
================================================================================

OVERVIEW: Questions 1–3 establish the foundational analytics layer:
- Q1: Baseline churn rate (executive KPI)
- Q2: Churn trend over time (detection of seasonality, inflection points)
- Q3: Regional churn variation (geographic strategy)

These three questions set the foundation for all subsequent analysis (Q4–Q14).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 1: WHAT IS OUR BASELINE CHURN RATE?

OBJECTIVE:
Establish a single source of truth for churn rate—the most critical metric for
executive reporting, board communication, and retention goal-setting.

BUSINESS INTENT:
Stakeholders need to know: "What percentage of our customer base has churned?"
This KPI is used for monthly trend tracking, quarterly board reports, and
investor communication.

AUDIENCE: C-Suite (CEO, CFO), Customer Success Leadership, Investor Relations
PRIORITY: Tier 1, Phase 1 (Foundational—build first)
SEQUENCE: Question #1 (must build first; foundation for all others)

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns:
    - Churn_Flag (Yes/No or 1/0): Whether customer churned
    - Customer_ID: Unique customer identifier (for DISTINCTCOUNT)
    - Report_Month: Analysis period (for filtering)
  Optional: Total_Revenue (for revenue-weighted churn variant)

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
  ✓ Set baseline KPI for churn reduction targets
  ✓ Enable monthly churn tracking and goal progress reporting
  ✓ Justify investment in retention initiatives
  ✓ Communicate customer health status to stakeholders

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
  Churn rate typically ranges 5–15% monthly depending on industry.
  - Elevated (>20%): Suggests operational issues; escalate investigation
  - Low (<5%): May indicate data quality issues or segment exclusion

DATA PREPARATION (Power Query):
  See Section "PHASE 1: DATA IMPORT & PREPARATION" below

DATA MODEL DESIGN (Star Schema):
  See Section "DATA MODEL DESIGN (STAR SCHEMA)" below
  Key relationship: dim_Calendar → fact_customer_churn (Churn_Date)

DAX MEASURES (Core KPI):

  Base Measure 1: Total Customers
  Total Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
  Format: Whole number
  Purpose: Denominator for churn rate

  Base Measure 2: Churned Customers
  Churned Customers = CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS('fact_customer_churn'),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
  )
  Format: Whole number
  Purpose: Numerator for churn rate

  Base Measure 3: Active Customers
  Active Customers = CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
    'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = FALSE()
  )
  Format: Whole number
  Purpose: Health metric (Total = Active + Churned)

  Q1 MEASURE: Churn Rate %
  Churn Rate % = 
    VAR TotalCount = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
    VAR ChurnCount = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    RETURN
      IF(TotalCount = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(ChurnCount, TotalCount) * 100)
  
  Format: Percentage, 1 decimal (e.g., 15.2%)
  Purpose: Primary KPI for Q1

RECOMMENDED VISUALS:

  Visual 1: KPI Card (Baseline Churn Rate)
  Layout:
    - Visual type: Card (single-number display)
    - Field: [Churn Rate %] measure
    - Title: "Churn Rate"
    - Format: Large font (35pt+), percentage symbol
    - Filters to apply: Report_Month (current or YTD)
  
  Expected display: "15.2%"
  
  Visual 2: Summary KPI Cards (Context)
  Layout:
    - Card 1: Total Customers (e.g., "1,250")
    - Card 2: Churned Customers (e.g., "187")
    - Card 3: Active Customers (e.g., "1,063")
  
  Visual 3: Reference Table (Detail)
  Layout:
    - Rows: (Optional; global summary only)
    - Columns: Total, Churned, Active, Churn %
    - Single row showing global metrics

REPORT PAGE DESIGN:
  Page name: "Executive Dashboard"
  Purpose: C-level churn KPI overview
  Layout:
    - Top-left: KPI card (churn %)
    - Top-right: Line chart (trend, Q2)
    - Bottom: Regional breakdown (Q3)
    - Footer: Add slicers (Report_Month, Region, Segment)

SLICERS TO APPLY:
  - Report_Month: Dropdown (select current month or YTD)
  - Region: Dropdown (optional; leave blank for global, or select one)
  - Customer_Segment: Dropdown (optional; advanced filtering)

FILTERS & INTERACTIONS:
  - Slicers automatically filter KPI card
  - No manual cross-filtering needed for this page
  - Drill-down (optional): Clicking KPI card could drill to Regional Details

TESTING & VALIDATION:
  
  Step 1: Data Validation
    ☐ Verify churn data exists: fact_customer_churn has 25,000+ rows
    ☐ Verify Churn_Flag values: Only 0/1 or TRUE/FALSE (no other values)
    ☐ Verify no nulls in Churn_Flag: All rows have churn status
    ☐ Verify date range: Covers analysis period (e.g., 12 months)
  
  Step 2: Measure Validation (Manual Spot-Check)
    Method:
      1. Export fact_customer_churn to Excel
      2. Create pivot: Rows = none, Values = COUNT(distinct Customer_ID)
      3. Add filter: WHERE Churn_Flag = 1
      4. Calculate: Churned / Total * 100 = Churn %
      5. Compare to Power BI KPI card
    
    Expected: Excel churn % ≈ PBI churn % (within 0.5%)
    Example:
      Excel: 679 churned / 4,000 total = 16.98% ≈ 17.0% (PBI matches)
  
  Step 3: Visual Validation
    ☐ KPI card displays percentage (e.g., "17.0%")
    ☐ Font size is readable (35pt+)
    ☐ Format includes % symbol
    ☐ Filters update card: Change month filter, card updates
    ☐ No errors or null displays

  Step 4: Acceptance Criteria
    ✓ KPI card displays current churn rate accurate to 0.5%
    ✓ Measure matches manual Excel calculation
    ✓ Filters (Region, Month) update KPI correctly
    ✓ Format is percentage with 1 decimal place

EXPECTED INSIGHTS & ACTIONS:
  
  Scenario A: Churn rate = 17% (typical SaaS range)
    Insight: In-line with industry; focus on drivers (Q2–Q14)
    Action: Set target (e.g., "reduce to 12% by Q4"), track monthly
  
  Scenario B: Churn rate = 28% (high/alarming)
    Insight: Above healthy range; suggests product fit or support issues
    Action: Urgent analysis of drivers (Q7–Q10); escalate to leadership
    Investigation steps:
      - Does churn spike after certain date? (Q2 trend analysis)
      - Which region drives high churn? (Q3)
      - Which customer type affected? (Q4–Q6)
      - Is it usage (Q8) or support quality (Q9)?
  
  Scenario C: Churn rate = 3% (low)
    Insight: Below typical; possible data quality issue or selection bias
    Action: Validate data (exclude free tier? old customers excluded?)
    Assumption check: Is analysis period long enough? Are all customers included?

BUSINESS OUTCOME (if implemented):
  - Executives have weekly churn dashboard (current rate visible)
  - Board reporting improved (accurate, auditable metric)
  - Retention targets set (e.g., "Q4 goal: <15% churn")
  - Monthly accountability: Sales, CS, Product teams track progress

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 2: HOW HAS CHURN TRENDED OVER THE ANALYSIS PERIOD?

OBJECTIVE:
Detect seasonal patterns, growth/decline trends, and inflection points that
warrant investigation or action.

BUSINESS INTENT:
Understand churn momentum: Is churn rising (troubling), stable (acceptable),
or declining (positive indicator of retention efforts)?

AUDIENCE: Customer Success Leadership, Product Management, Operations
PRIORITY: Tier 1, Phase 1 (Foundational)
SEQUENCE: Question #2 (depends on Q1 measures; use same base dimension)

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns:
    - Churn_Date (date): When customer churned
    - Churn_Flag: To identify churned customers
    - Customer_ID: For distinct count
    - Report_Month (derived or source): Monthly period identifier
  Related: Calendar dimension (YearMonth_Text, MonthName, etc.)

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
  ✓ Identify seasonal peaks (e.g., Q4 budget cuts driving churn)
  ✓ Measure effectiveness of past retention campaigns
  ✓ Forecast near-term churn risk
  ✓ Support product roadmap decisions (correlate with feature launches)

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
  Common pattern (bathtub-like):
    - Q4 spike due to budget cycles, holiday disruptions
    - Q1–Q2 trough (new year, fresh budgets, spring growth)
    - Seasonal cycle repeats annually
  Trend direction:
    - Rising trend: Churn increasing 1% per month (urgent)
    - Stable trend: Flat churn month-to-month (manageable)
    - Declining trend: Churn decreasing (positive signal)

DAX MEASURES:

  Q2 MEASURE: Monthly Churn Rate %
  Monthly Churn Rate % = 
    VAR MonthTotal = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
    VAR MonthChurned = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    RETURN
      IF(MonthTotal = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(MonthChurned, MonthTotal) * 100)
  
  Format: Percentage, 1 decimal
  Purpose: Auto-filters by month when used on time-based chart
  
  Optional: Churn Rate % Prior Month (for MoM comparison)
  Churn Rate % Prior Month = 
    VAR PriorMonthDate = EOMONTH(MAX('dim_Calendar'[Date]), -1)
    VAR PriorChurnRate = CALCULATE(
      [Churn Rate %],
      'dim_Calendar'[Date] = PriorMonthDate
    )
    RETURN
      PriorChurnRate

RECOMMENDED VISUALS:

  Visual 1: Line Chart (Churn Trend)
  Layout:
    - X-axis: Month (YearMonth_Text) in chronological order
    - Y-axis: [Monthly Churn Rate %] measure

    Y-axis: 0% to 30% (or max observed)
    Line shows: Jan 12% → Feb 14% → Mar 13% → Apr 18% (upward trend visible)
  
  Visual 2: Reference Table (Detailed Breakdown)
  Layout:
    - Rows: Month
    - Columns: Total Customers, Churned, Active, Churn %
    - Sort: Chronologically (oldest to newest)
  
  Purpose: Audit values, spot anomalies
  Example:
    Month  | Total | Churned | Active | Churn %
    ───────────────────────────────────────────
    2024-01|  800  |   96    |  704   | 12.0%
    2024-02|  850  |  119    |  731   | 14.0%
    2024-03|  900  |  117    |  783   | 13.0%

REPORT PAGE DESIGN:
  Integrate into "Executive Dashboard" (same page as Q1 KPI)
  Position: Top-center or right, next to KPI card
  Height: ~400px, width: ~800px (substantial to show 12-month trend)

SLICERS & FILTERS:
  - Report_Month: Allow range selection (e.g., last 12 months)
  - Region: Optional (apply if analyzing specific region trend)

TESTING & VALIDATION:

  Step 1: Data Check
    ☐ Verify Churn_Date column populated: No nulls or errors
    ☐ Verify date range: Covers 12+ months
    ☐ Verify no future dates: All Churn_Date <= TODAY()
  
  Step 2: Trend Validation
    Method:
      1. Export monthly pivot (month, churn %) from Excel
      2. Compare trend direction to Power BI line chart
      3. Values should match (within 0.2%)
  
  Step 3: Visual Validation
    ☐ X-axis: Month labels in order (Jan, Feb, Mar, …)
    ☐ Y-axis: 0% at bottom, appropriate max at top
    ☐ Line connects all months (no gaps)
    ☐ Data labels show on each point
    ☐ Trend line (if added) points up or down correctly
  
  Step 4: Acceptance
    ✓ Chart shows month-to-month churn pattern
    ✓ Trend direction clear (increasing, stable, decreasing)
    ✓ Values match manual Excel pivot ±0.2%

EXPECTED INSIGHTS & ACTIONS:

  Scenario A: Upward Trend (Churn rising 1%+ per month)
    Insight: Deteriorating retention (red flag)
    Action:
      1. Investigate root cause
         - New competitor? Product issue? Support problem?
      2. Cross-reference with Q3 (regional), Q4–Q10 (drivers)
      3. Escalate to CEO, VP CS; declare "churn emergency"
      4. Allocate resources: "Every team focus on churn reduction"
    
    Example: "Churn rose from 12% (Jan) to 18% (Jun). Analysis shows
    East region driving it (Q3). Root cause: High support tickets (Q9) +
    low satisfaction (Q10). Solution: Hire support staff, improve SLA."
  
  Scenario B: Seasonal Pattern (Spike in Q4, trough in Q2)
    Insight: Predictable seasonal variation (manageable)
    Action:
      1. Time retention campaigns BEFORE Q4 (Sep/Oct)
      2. Increase CS resources in Q4 (staff up in advance)
      3. Special Q4 offers: "Renew now for Q1 discount"
      4. Forecast: Use seasonal pattern for budgeting
    
    Example: "Churn spikes 15–20% in Nov–Dec (vs. avg 14%). Pre-plan
    retention campaigns in Sep. Expect this pattern to repeat."
  
  Scenario C: Flat/Stable Trend
    Insight: Churn is stable (retention efforts working or stalled)
    Action:
      1. Maintain current strategy
      2. Monitor Q3–Q10 for shifting drivers (usage, support, satisfaction)
      3. Set incremental improvement targets ("12% → 10% by EOY")

BUSINESS OUTCOME:
  - Churn trend dashboard enables rapid detection of problems
  - Seasonal planning informed (budget, staffing, campaigns)
  - Early warning: If trend flips, escalation is automatic
  - ROI tracking: Measure impact of retention initiatives ("Campaign launched
    in Sep reduced Oct churn from expected 18% to 15%")

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 3: WHICH GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS SHOW THE HIGHEST CHURN RATES?

OBJECTIVE:
Identify high-churn regions and enable localized retention strategies.

BUSINESS INTENT:
Allocate customer success and marketing budget to regions needing most help.

AUDIENCE: Regional Sales Leaders, Customer Success Leadership, Marketing
PRIORITY: Tier 3, Phase 2 (Geographic segmentation)

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
  Table: fact_customer_churn
  Columns:
    - Region (North, South, East, West)
    - Churn_Flag, Customer_ID, Report_Month
  Optional: City, State (for deeper drill-down)

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
  ✓ Regionalize retention strategy (e.g., localized support in East)
  ✓ Identify regional service gaps or product fit issues
  ✓ Benchmark regions; set regional targets
  ✓ Support hiring/resourcing decisions

EXPECTED INSIGHT:
  Geographic variation correlates with service availability, language support,
  local competition. Example:
    - Urban East: 20% churn (better infrastructure)
    - Rural West: 25% churn (limited support resources)
  This drives resource allocation: Hire CSMs in West first.

DAX MEASURES:

  Q3 MEASURE: Regional Churn Rate %
  Regional Churn Rate % = [Churn Rate %]
  // Standard measure auto-filters by Region context
  
  Or explicit:
  Regional Churn Rate = 
    VAR RegionalTotal = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
    VAR RegionalChurned = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    RETURN
      IF(RegionalTotal = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(RegionalChurned, RegionalTotal) * 100)

RECOMMENDED VISUALS:

  Visual 1: Column Chart (Regional Churn)
  Layout:
    - X-axis: Region (North, South, East, West)
    - Y-axis: [Regional Churn Rate %]
    - Sort: Descending (highest churn first, left-aligned)
    - Color: Conditional formatting (green = low, red = high)
    - Data labels: ON (show % on bar tops)
  
  Expected display:
    East: 22.1% (RED, tallest)
    South: 18.3% (YELLOW)
    West: 14.0% (YELLOW)
    North: 12.0% (GREEN, shortest)

REPORT PAGE DESIGN:
  Position: Bottom-left or bottom-center of Executive Dashboard
  Size: ~650px × 400px

TESTING & VALIDATION:
  ☐ All 4 regions display (no missing regions)
  ☐ Bars sorted correctly (highest churn on left)
  ☐ Color gradient applied (red = high, green = low)
  ☐ Values accurate to 0.1%

EXPECTED INSIGHTS & ACTIONS:

  Scenario: East 22% vs. North 12% (1.83x difference)
    Insight: East has materially higher churn
    Action:
      1. Investigate East-specific factors:
         - Are they newer customers? (Q7 tenure analysis)
         - Low product usage? (Q8)
         - High support frustration? (Q9–Q10)
      2. Best-practice transfer: What does North do well?
         "North has lowest churn—adopt their onboarding playbook in East"
      3. Resource allocation: Add CS headcount in East
      4. Regional strategy: Localize support (language, timezone, culture)
    
    Example: "East churn 22% vs. global 17%. Drilling in (Q4–Q10):
    East has many 18–25 age customers on Monthly contracts (high-risk profile).
    Solution: Target East with age-specific onboarding, incentivize annual
    contracts. Expected outcome: East churn 22% → 15% in 6 months."

BUSINESS OUTCOME:
  - Regional accountability: Each region leader owns churn target
  - Targeted CS investment: High-churn region gets resources
  - Geographic playbooks: East/West/North/South have tailored strategies

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Remaining questions (Q4–Q14) would follow similar structure]

Due to length constraints, I've provided Q1–Q3 template in detail.

Questions Q4–Q14 follow the same pattern in the following condensed sections.

================================================================================
QUESTION 4: HOW DOES CHURN VARY BY CUSTOMER AGE GROUP?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Understand demographic churn drivers
- Expected: Younger 18–25 show 25–30% churn; older 45+ show 8–12%
- Action: Tailor engagement and messaging by age cohort
- Measure: [Churn Rate %] filters automatically by Age_Group
- Visual: Column chart, Age_Group on X-axis, churn % on Y-axis
- Insight: Younger = lower commitment; older = higher loyalty if onboarded

Data Model: Add Age_Group column (bucketed: 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 45+)
Validation: Spot-check churn % by age vs. manual pivot
Business Action: 18–25 age group needs specialized onboarding (gamification, mobile-first)

================================================================================
QUESTION 5: HOW DOES CONTRACT TYPE AFFECT CHURN RATES?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Optimize contract terms for retention
- Expected: Monthly 25%, Quarterly 14%, Annual 8% (3x variation)
- Action: Incentivize longer contracts; discount annuals
- Measure: [Churn Rate %] filters by Contract_Type
- Visual: Pie chart (distribution of churn volume), Column chart (churn % by type)
- Insight: Length of commitment = lock-in benefit

Business Case:
  Monthly contracts = high acquisition friction, low commitment = high churn
  Annual contracts = commitment device = stickier
  Recommendation: Annual contracts 20% discount justified by 3x lower churn

================================================================================
QUESTION 6: DOES PAYMENT METHOD CORRELATE WITH CHURN?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Reduce payment friction churn
- Expected: Cash 22%, Debit 14%, UPI 12%, Credit Card 8%
- Action: Incentivize credit card auto-renewal; deprecate manual payment
- Measure: [Churn Rate %] filters by Payment_Method
- Visual: Stacked bar (churned vs. active by payment method)
- Insight: Auto-payment reduces churn (removes manual renewal friction)

================================================================================
QUESTION 7: HOW DOES CUSTOMER TENURE INFLUENCE CHURN RATE?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Identify lifecycle stages and critical churn windows
- Expected: Bathtub curve—0–3 months 35%, 4–6 months 15%, 25+ months <5%
- Action: Intensive onboarding in months 0–3 (highest ROI)
- Measure: [Churn Rate %] filters by Tenure_Bucket
- Visual: Area chart (churn % across tenure buckets), trend line
- Insight: Early churn is highest; focus here has biggest impact

Key Insight: Most churn happens in first 3 months (onboarding failure)
Business Action: Invest in onboarding (1:1 training, early wins, check-ins)
Expected: 0–3 month churn 35% → 20% (major improvement)

================================================================================
QUESTION 8: HOW DOES USAGE LEVEL CORRELATE WITH CHURN RISK?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Early warning system using product engagement
- Expected: Churned customers use 30–50% less than active
- Action: Proactive outreach to low-usage customers
- Measure: [Avg Usage Churned] vs. [Avg Usage Active] comparison
- Visual: Scatter plot (usage X-axis, satisfaction Y-axis, color by churn)
- Insight: Usage drop = leading churn indicator (30–60 days before churn)

Usage as Early Warning:
  - Zero usage for 14+ days = red flag, trigger outreach
  - Usage drop >50% from baseline = at-risk alert
  - Reactivation rate: 20–30% of at-risk customers can be recovered

================================================================================
QUESTION 9: ARE SUPPORT TICKET VOLUMES A CHURN INDICATOR?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Link support quality to churn
- Expected: Churned avg 3 tickets/month vs. active avg 1 ticket/month
- Action: Improve support SLA, speed of resolution
- Measure: [Avg Support Tickets Churned] vs. [Avg Support Tickets Active]
- Visual: Box & whisker plot showing distribution
- Insight: Could be (A) symptom (customer frustrated) or (B) sign of problem

Interpretation:
  - High tickets + low satisfaction = support is churn driver (fix SLA)
  - High tickets + high satisfaction = engaged, complex customer (expected)
  - Zero tickets + churn = non-engagement (product fit issue)

================================================================================
QUESTION 10: HOW DOES CUSTOMER SATISFACTION RELATE TO CHURN?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Use satisfaction as leading churn indicator
- Expected cliff: Satisfaction 3.0 → 2.0 = churn jumps 18% → 35%
- Action: Flag satisfaction <3.0 for outreach; improve satisfaction quality
- Measure: [Avg Satisfaction Churned] vs. [Avg Satisfaction Active]
- Visual: Gauge chart (satisfaction 1–5 scale), Stacked area (distribution trend)
- Insight: Satisfaction drop 2–4 weeks before churn

Business Action:
  - Monthly CSAT survey (post-support ticket)
  - Alert: Org avg satisfaction <3.5 = escalate
  - Target: Improve satisfaction 3.7 → 4.0 (reduce churn 2–3%)

================================================================================
QUESTION 11: WHICH CUSTOMER SEGMENTS ARE AT HIGHEST CHURN RISK?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Create risk segments for prioritized retention
- Expected: 18–25 + Monthly + Cash = 30%+ churn (extreme risk)
          45+ + Annual + Credit Card = ~2% churn (low risk)
- Action: Allocate retention resources to high-risk segments
- Measure: [Churn Rate %] filters by multiple dimensions (Age × Contract × Payment)
- Visual: Heatmap (rows = Age, cols = Contract, values = churn %)
- Insight: Portfolio concentration risk = 10% of customers drive 40% of churn

Risk Segmentation Matrix Example:
  Age\Contract   Monthly   Quarterly   Annual
  18–25          28.3%     16.2%       8.5%
  26–35          18.5%     12.8%       4.2%
  36–45          14.1%     9.3%        2.8%
  45+            11.8%     8.2%        2.1%

Action: Segment-specific playbooks
  - High-risk (30%+): Daily engagement, strong incentives
  - Medium-risk (15–20%): Weekly check-ins, moderate incentives
  - Low-risk (<10%): Quarterly reviews, premium support

================================================================================
QUESTION 12: WHAT IS THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF CHURN?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Quantify churn cost for business case
- Expected: 679 churn/period @ $75 avg revenue = $101,850 lost
- Action: Justify retention investment (cost-benefit analysis)
- Measure: [Total Revenue Lost (Churned)], [MRR Lost to Churn], [Annual Revenue at Risk]
- Visual: Waterfall chart (MRR baseline → churn loss → new adds → final MRR)
- Insight: Churn costs $600K+/year (if 15% monthly on $4K MRR base)

LTV & Payback Analysis:
  - Avg customer LTV: $1,350 (tenure 18 mo × $75/mo)
  - Annual revenue at risk: $611K (679 churned × $900 yearly value)
  - CS team investment: $150K/year
  - If CS reduces churn 5%: Save $180K (ROI +20%)
  - Payback period: 10 months (exceeds 1-year cycle; justifies investment)

================================================================================
QUESTION 13: ARE THERE EARLY WARNING SIGNALS PREDICTING IMMINENT CHURN?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Build rule-based risk scoring system
- Expected: Customers with 3+ risk signals have 60%+ 30-day churn probability
- Action: Daily alerts for critical customers; trigger outreach
- Measure: [Churn Risk Score] (0–4 points), [Churn Risk Category] (Critical/High/Med/Low)
- Visual: Gauge (critical customer count), Table (flagged customers for CS action)
- Insight: Rule-based segmentation enables daily monitoring

Churn Risk Scoring (Rule-Based, No ML):
  +1 point if: New customer (tenure ≤ 6 months)
  +1 point if: Usage drop >50% from average
  +1 point if: Support tickets ≥ 3/month
  +1 point if: Satisfaction ≤ 2/5

  Risk Score 3–4 = CRITICAL (60%+ churn prob, needs urgent outreach)
  Risk Score 2 = HIGH (30–50% churn prob)
  Risk Score 1 = MEDIUM (10–20% churn prob)
  Risk Score 0 = LOW (<5% churn prob)

Backtesting Validation:
  Of churned customers in last 30 days, % that were flagged = 70%+ (target)
  If <70%: Add more signals (payment failures, login gaps, etc.)

================================================================================
QUESTION 14: WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MONTHLY CHARGES AND CHURN RATE?

QUICK SUMMARY:
- Objective: Determine if churn is price-driven or value-driven
- Expected: Typical pattern = low price/high churn midrange, high price/lower churn
- Action: Optimize pricing tiers; inform discount strategy
- Measure: [Churn Rate %] by Price_Tier, [Avg Charges Churned] vs. [Avg Charges Active]
- Visual: Scatter plot (price X-axis, churn rate Y-axis, color by segment)
- Insight: Non-linear; often U-shaped or step-wise

Price Sensitivity Patterns:
  
  Pattern A: Increasing churn with price (Right-skewed, red)
    Interpretation: Price is barrier (low price = low commitment, high price = unaffordable)
    Action: Reduce mid-tier pricing; improve value communication
  
  Pattern B: U-shaped (High at low & high price, low in middle)
    Interpretation: Low = non-committed; high = committed; mid = price-sensitive
    Action: Move customers to high tier (value clarity); avoid mid tier
  
  Pattern C: Declining churn with price (Left-skewed)
    Interpretation: Higher price = higher commitment device
    Action: Price increases feasible; no churn impact

Pricing Tiers Example:
  Entry (<$50/mo):    High churn (28%) — low commitment
  Mid ($50-200/mo):   Medium churn (15%) — price sensitive
  Pro ($200-500/mo):  Lower churn (8%) — committed, value clear
  Enterprise ($500+): Lowest churn (3%) — high switching cost

================================================================================
PART 5: BEST PRACTICES & NAMING CONVENTIONS
================================================================================

MEASURE NAMING STANDARDS

All measures should follow consistent naming conventions for clarity and maintenance.

Format: [Metric | By Dimension] = [Unit]

Examples:
  [Churn Rate %] — Global churn percentage
  [Churned Customers] — Count of churned customers
  [Avg Tenure Months] — Average customer tenure
  [Revenue Lost (Churned)] — Total revenue from churned customers
  [Revenue at Risk (Critical)] — Monthly charges at risk from critical segment

Rules:
  1. Use [square brackets] for all measures
  2. Start with action verb or metric: Churn, Count, Avg, Sum, Revenue, etc.
  3. Add clarifying context if needed: "(by Age)", "(Churned)", "(Active)", etc.
  4. Include unit: %, $, mo., #, /5
  5. Spell out; avoid abbreviations (Churn not CH, Tenure not TEN)
  6. Consistency: [Churn Rate %] not [Churn Rate]; don't mix formats

COLUMN NAMING STANDARDS

Format: ColumnName_Attribute or ColumnName (PascalCase, underscores between parts)

Examples:
  Customer_ID (primary key)
  Churn_Flag (boolean, 0/1)
  Monthly_Charges (numeric, with unit)
  Satisfaction_Score (numeric, 1–5)
  Join_Date (date, YYYY-MM-DD)
  Churn_Risk_Profile (categorical: Critical/High/Medium/Low)

Rules:
  1. PascalCase with underscores: Customer_ID, not CustomerId
  2. Descriptive: "Join_Date" clear; "Joined" OK too (pick one style, be consistent)
  3. Unit in name if ambiguous: "Tenure_Months", "Monthly_Charges"
  4. Boolean: Use _Flag suffix: "Churn_Flag", "Complaint_Flag"
  5. Calculated columns: "(Calc)" suffix: "Age_Group (Calc)"
  6. Derived columns: Explicit formula in column header if needed

VISUAL NAMING STANDARDS

Format: [Business Question] - [Visual Type] - [Key Metric]

Examples:
  "Baseline Churn - KPI Card"
  "Monthly Churn Trend - Line Chart"
  "Regional Churn - Column Chart"
  "Risk Matrix - Heatmap"
  "Revenue Impact - Waterfall"

Rules:
  1. Name reflects question being answered (what insight does this provide?)
  2. Include visual type (helps identify for future use)
  3. Concise (3–5 words max)
  4. Consistent with page theme

TABLE NAMING STANDARDS

Format: [dim_Dimension] or [fact_Subject]

Examples:
  dim_Calendar
  dim_Customer
  dim_Contract
  dim_Payment
  fact_customer_churn

Rules:
  1. Prefix: dim_ for dimensions, fact_ for facts (star schema)
  2. Singular: dim_Contract, not dim_Contracts
  3. Descriptive, unambiguous
  4. Lowercase (convention)

DAX COMMENTING STANDARDS

Each measure should have a brief comment explaining purpose and context.

Format: // [Purpose]. [Logic if complex]. [Example if helpful].

Example:

  Churn Rate % = 
    // Percentage of distinct customers with Churn_Flag = TRUE.
    // Auto-adjusts to filter context (Region, Age_Group, Report_Month, etc.).
    // Example: Filtering by Region = "East" shows churn % for East only.
    VAR TotalCount = DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID])
    VAR ChurnCount = CALCULATE(
      DISTINCTCOUNT('fact_customer_churn'[Customer_ID]),
      'fact_customer_churn'[Churn_Flag] = TRUE()
    )
    RETURN
      IF(TotalCount = 0, BLANK(), DIVIDE(ChurnCount, TotalCount) * 100)

Rules:
  1. One-line comment above measure
  2. Explain purpose (what question does it answer?)
  3. Note context-sensitivity
  4. Give example if formula is non-obvious
  5. Keep succinct (<2 lines)

PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION BEST PRACTICES

DAX:
  - Use VAR for multi-use subexpressions (avoid recalculation)
  - DISTINCTCOUNT for counting distinct; COUNT for row count
  - CALCULATE for filtering; avoid iterative functions (SUMPRODUCT)
  - Filter at source (WHERE clause) not in RETURN statement

Power Query:
  - Remove unnecessary columns early (reduce size)
  - Delete duplicates in source, not in Power BI
  - Unfold related tables before merge (if possible)
  - Close & Apply to load; Transform Data only when editing

Data Model:
  - Avoid many-to-many relationships (use bridge tables)
  - Keep fact table normalized; avoid redundant columns
  - All dimensions connect to fact (no floating tables)
  - Mark date tables correctly (Model > Mark Date Table)

Visuals:
  - Limit visuals per page (4–6 max; avoid clutter)
  - Consistent color scheme (Blue primary, Red alert, Green good)
  - Data labels only when necessary (avoid overlap)
  - Legends not needed if axis labels clear

DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

Every measure should have entry in Measure Dictionary:

  Name: [Churn Rate %]
  Category: KPI
  Question(s): Q1, Q2, Q3 (all build on this base)
  Formula: [DAX code]
  Purpose: "What % of our customers churned?"
  Format: Percentage, 1 decimal
  Refresh: Daily (with data)
  Sensitivity: All filters apply (Region, Age_Group, Report_Month, etc.)
  Example: 17.0% (global), 22.1% (East), 28.3% (18–25 age)
